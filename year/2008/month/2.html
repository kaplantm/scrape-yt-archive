What was expected to be a short movie that would circulate within a small circle of friends has turned into something much more very quickly.  I&#x27;m thrilled that so many people have enjoyed this video but also somewhat mortified that I added this without my daughter&#x27;s knowledge or consent.  Maybe someday she will find some humor in it.

Comments: Have been disabled.  I think they have run their course.  To those who have sent positive comments, thank you very much.  You&#x27;ve made us appreciate what we have even more than we already do.  To those of you who&#x27;ve said you&#x27;ve changed your mind about having children, well, have at it. :)

Business inquiries/agents: Thanks for your interest.  At the current time we have no intention of exposing our little one to the destroyer of youth that is the entertainment industry.  Hopefully if she chooses to follow this path on her own someday she will find a door still open for her.

Other things: 

She has never seen Pokemon so I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s making a reference to the ball on that show.  I think she just means pokey ball as in &quot;a ball that is pokey.&quot;  (And yes, I know what the pokey balls really are!  Stop emailing :) )

Three year olds can&#x27;t read.  I&#x27;m sure there are exceptions to that rule. 

------------------------------ -------

From www.fistofblog.com

Here is my daughter, age 3, explaining the plot of Star Wars Episode IV.

She explained the whole movie to me in much greater detail but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have the camera going.  When I finally caught her talking about the movie again she delivered this truncated, but still funny, version.

Edit: Thank you all for the nice comments.  Maybe I will print them out for her and someday and when she&#x27;s all growed up she&#x27;ll get to read them herself.

A little more about the video: She wasn&#x27;t coached to say anything, nor was she forced to make the video.  She rarely stops talking.  Those of you with children understand this: sometimes it&#x27;s harder to turn the faucet off than to turn the faucet on.

Believe it or not, she has the seem the movie only once, and I spread it out over 3 days so it wouldn&#x27;t be too much all at once for her.

The video was edited to make it shorter, more cohesive and hopefully funnier.  I did move some of the lines around so it would make more sense.

This video might be on TV soon. But I like YouTube better anyway.

And in response to the many comments here on the matter: I realize my hairdo is weird. This is because I have no sense of fashion. Now that you&#x27;ve brought it to my attention, a barber is probably in my near future. :)</li><li class="mt-2">Uploaded by<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@cwajh" class="text-cyan-600 underline">cwajh</a></li></ul><details class="z-10 h-6"><summary>Stats for Nerds</summary><ul class="flex flex-col gap-2 bg-zinc-900 p-4 rounded-md border-red-700 border"><li>VideoId: <!-- -->gq5shhIckus</li><li>Author username: <!-- -->cwajh</li><li>Author display name at time of feature:<!-- --> <!-- -->cwajh</li><li>Historical Author Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/cwajh" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/user/cwajh</a></li></ul></li><li>Historical Video Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq5shhIckus" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq5shhIckus</a></li></ul></li><li>Wayback Homepage feature Links:<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080205181436/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080205181436/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080206154302/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080206154302/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080206192918/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080206192918/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080207010840/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080207010840/http://youtube.com/</a></li></ul></li></ul></details></div><div class="flex gap-5 flex-col bg-zinc-900 rounded-md py-8 px-8 items-start border-red-700 border"><div class="flex gap-1 w-full place-content-between flex-col"><h5 class="bg-cyan-700 px-4 py-2 rounded-md whitespace-nowrap">Longest Feature Range</h5><span class="whitespace-nowrap pl-4"><p>First Feature: 2/27/2008</p><p>Latest Feature: 1/1/2009</p></span></div><div class="video-container rounded-md overflow-hidden"><iframe width="336" height="189" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EBM854BTGL0" title="YouTube video player - Star Wars according to a 3 year ..." frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><ul class="w-full"><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBM854BTGL0" class="font-lg font-bold underline">Star Wars according to a 3 year ...</a></li><li class="max-h-20 overflow-auto">02/26/08 Update: Wow.  What was expected to be a short movie that would circulate within a small circle of friends has turned into something much more very quickly.  I&#x27;m thrilled that so many people have enjoyed this video but also somewhat mortified that I added this without my daughter&#x27;s knowledge or consent.  Maybe someday she will find some humor in it.

Comments: Have been disabled.  I think they have run their course.  To those who have sent positive comments, thank you very much.  You&#x27;ve made us appreciate what we have even more than we already do.  To those of you who&#x27;ve said you&#x27;ve changed your mind about having children, well, have at it. :)

Business inquiries/agents: Thanks for your interest.  At the current time we have no intention of exposing our little one to the destroyer of youth that is the entertainment industry.  Hopefully if she chooses to follow this path on her own someday she will find a door still open for her.

Other things: 

She has never seen Pokemon so I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s making a reference to the ball on that show.  I think she just means pokey ball as in &quot;a ball that is pokey.&quot;  (And yes, I know what the pokey balls really are!  Stop emailing :) )

Three year olds can&#x27;t read.  I&#x27;m sure there are exceptions to that rule. 

------------------------------ -------

From www.fistofblog.com

Here is my daughter, age 3, explaining the plot of Star Wars Episode IV.

She explained the whole movie to me in much greater detail but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have the camera going.  When I finally caught her talking about the movie again she delivered this truncated, but still funny, version.

Edit: Thank you all for the nice comments.  Maybe I will print them out for her and someday and when she&#x27;s all growed up she&#x27;ll get to read them herself.

A little more about the video: She wasn&#x27;t coached to say anything, nor was she forced to make the video.  She rarely stops talking.  Those of you with children understand this: sometimes it&#x27;s harder to turn the faucet off than to turn the faucet on.

Believe it or not, she has the seem the movie only once, and I spread it out over 3 days so it wouldn&#x27;t be too much all at once for her.

The video was edited to make it shorter, more cohesive and hopefully funnier.  I did move some of the lines around so it would make more sense.
