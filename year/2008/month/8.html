From being born with Tourette Syndrome to getting struck by lightning; from having his testicle removed to developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease; Harvie&#x27;s troubles seem unending ! Yet, Harvie learns many lessons about life and enjoys its many fruits. He finds love, freedom, nudity and ultimately the true meaning of what it is to be human.Produced by Melodrama Pictures with the support of SBS Independent, Film Victoria and the Australian Film Commission, the picture features the voices of Geoffrey Rush (PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN), Kamahl (NED KELLY), Julie Forsyth (BABE) and John Flaus (THE DISH), and was written, directed and animated by Adam Elliot, produced by Melanie Coombs, edited by Bill Murphy and sound by Peter Walker and the team at Soundwaves.</li><li class="mt-2">Uploaded by<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@monsterdistr..." class="text-cyan-600 underline">monsterdistr...</a></li></ul><details class="z-10 h-6"><summary>Stats for Nerds</summary><ul class="flex flex-col gap-2 bg-zinc-900 p-4 rounded-md border-red-700 border"><li>VideoId: <!-- -->ouyVS6HOFeo</li><li>Author username: <!-- -->monsterdistr...</li><li>Author display name at time of feature:<!-- --> <!-- -->monsterdistr...</li><li>Historical Author Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/monsterdistributes" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/user/monsterdistributes</a></li></ul></li><li>Historical Video Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouyVS6HOFeo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouyVS6HOFeo</a></li></ul></li><li>Wayback Homepage feature Links:<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080801201316/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080801201316/http://youtube.com/</a></li></ul></li></ul></details></div><div class="flex gap-5 flex-col bg-zinc-900 rounded-md py-8 px-8 items-start border-red-700 border"><div class="flex gap-1 w-full place-content-between flex-col"><h5 class="bg-red-900 px-4 py-2 rounded-md whitespace-nowrap">Shortest</h5><span class="whitespace-nowrap pl-4">00:00:21</span></div><div class="video-container rounded-md overflow-hidden"><iframe width="336" height="189" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MXhaJELUJOY" title="YouTube video player - Mascot meltdown" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><ul class="w-full"><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhaJELUJOY" class="font-lg font-bold underline">Mascot meltdown</a></li><li class="max-h-20 overflow-auto">The Ohio State Fair displays a sculpture (a cow) made of butter each year.
