...</a></li><li class="max-h-20 overflow-auto">YouTube presents the world premiere of the music video for &quot;Pull Me Out Alive&quot; by Kaki King, the lead single from Kaki&#x27;s new album, Dreaming Of Revenge, available March 11, 2008 in stores and online.  The video was made without film cameras -- it consists of over 5,000 still photographs shot on Nikon D30s. There are no special effects; all of the light trails were created by hand, with  up to eight individual &quot;light animators&quot; flashing LEDs and flashlights on and off over a long (8 second) shot exposure.  The video was shot in NYC over five very cold, 16 hour days in January.  Special thanks to Eddie &amp; Doug at Chop Wood Carry Water, the talented crew, all the actors &amp; extras, Rockwood Music Hall, Jamie Proctor, YouTube and especially all Kaki&#x27;s fans who came to NYC from as far away as Virginia.

We&#x27;ll be posting a &quot;making of&quot; video on YouTube shortly.

&#x27;heima&#x27; is sigur rós&#x27;s first ever film, filmed over two weeks during the summer of 2006 when the band undertook a series of free, unannounced concerts in iceland. they hauled 40-plus people round 15 locations to the furthest flung corners of their homeland for their debut venture into live film, to create something, well, inspirational.

on their way they went to ghost towns, outsider art shrines, national parks, small community halls and the absolute middle-of-nowhere-ness of the highland wilderness, as well as playing the largest gig of their career (and in icelandic history) at their homecoming reykjavik show.

&#x27;heima&#x27; (icelandic for &quot;at home&quot; or &quot;homeland&quot;), truly, shows sigur rós as never before. whereas seeing the group live is normally a large-scale and sometimes overwhelming experience, making full use of lights and mesmeric visuals, &#x27;heima&#x27; was always intended to reveal more of what was actually going on on stage. it does this via long-held close-ups and a rare intimate proximity, without ever once breaking the spell.

loosely based on a documentary format - and including personal reflections from the band - &#x27;heima&#x27; also serves as an alternative primer for iceland the country, which is revealed as less stag destination-du-jour and more desolate, magical place where human beings have little right to trespass.

&#x27;heima&#x27; features performances of songs from all four sigur rós albums, many radically reworked, as well as two exclusive new songs in &#x27;guitardjamm&#x27;, which was filmed inside an abandoned herring oil tank in the far west of the country, and the traditional &#x27;a ferd til breidarfjardar 1922&#x27;, performed with poet steindor andersen.

&#x27;heima&#x27; was directed by dean deblois, a long-time fan of the band and director of the oscar-nominated animated feature &#x27;lilo &amp; stitch&#x27;, using an icelandic crew.
