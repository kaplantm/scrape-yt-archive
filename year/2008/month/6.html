He currently teaches in the after school music program &#x27;Smile A While&#x27; at Aveson Charter School http://aveson.org/ and constructs musical instruments in classes with students&#x27; participation.Michael Greiner created this set of plastic pipe marimbas.  On this clip are three generations of prototypes designed to be low cost for use by childrens&#x27; programming.  The middle row were built with the help of the music class (the performers in this video) The top one (bass version) costs around $200 in materials.   The mallets are home made using foam flip-flops mounted to paint stirring sticks. The music is a Michael Greiner original titled Caribbean Fantasy.  This recording was of a practice during the school year.  The performers had about 4 months practice with this piece along with 12 Bar Blues, Ice Cream, a piece played on Wine Glasses and the Ukrainian Carol (Carol of the Bells) played on another created metal instrument.Filmed at Norma Coombs primary school in Altadena CA in 2007.*** Edited to Add ****Wow, it looks like this video&#x27;s hit YouTube&#x27;s front page.

The impulsive purchase of a two-wheeled Segway scooter sets this story in motion when the two friends decide to travel from Seattle to Boston at 10 MPH in an attempt to change their lives forever... What ensues is a road trip like none other with a haphazard cast of characters you could only find on a zany 100-day trek through America&#x27;s back roads. Each poignant story the two friends discover along the way inspires a craving inside to go out and do that thing you&#x27;re supposed to do.</li><li class="mt-2">Uploaded by<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@10mph" class="text-cyan-600 underline">10mph</a></li></ul><details class="z-10 h-6"><summary>Stats for Nerds</summary><ul class="flex flex-col gap-2 bg-zinc-900 p-4 rounded-md border-red-700 border"><li>VideoId: <!-- -->DdR41fe9Zeg</li><li>Author username: <!-- -->10mph</li><li>Author display name at time of feature:<!-- --> <!-- -->10mph</li><li>Historical Author Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/10mph" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/user/10mph</a></li><li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/10mph" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/user/10mph</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/10mph" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/10mph</a></li></ul></li><li>Historical Video Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdR41fe9Zeg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdR41fe9Zeg</a></li></ul></li><li>Wayback Homepage feature Links:<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080602141408/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080602141408/http://youtube.com/</a></li></ul></li></ul></details></div><div class="flex gap-5 flex-col bg-zinc-900 rounded-md py-8 px-8 items-start border-red-700 border"><div class="flex gap-1 w-full place-content-between flex-col"><h5 class="bg-red-900 px-4 py-2 rounded-md whitespace-nowrap">Shortest</h5><span class="whitespace-nowrap pl-4">00:00:24</span></div><div class="video-container rounded-md overflow-hidden"><iframe width="336" height="189" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5w7i_1gDCVk" title="YouTube video player - Current 3-6-3 Timed Team Relay World Record ~13.19" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer;
