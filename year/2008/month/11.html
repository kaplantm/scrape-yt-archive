In the frontier city of Carpathia, Jasper Morello discovers that his former adversary Doctor Claude Belgon has returned from the grave. When Claude reveals that he knows the location of the ancient city of Alto Mea where the secrets of life have been discovered, Jasper cannot resist the temptation to bring his own dead wife Amelia back. But they are captured by Armand Forgette, leader of the radical Horizontalist anti-technology movement, who is determined to reanimate his terrorist father Vasco. As lightning energises the arcane machineries of life in the floating castle of Alto Mea, Jasper must choose between having his beloved restored or seeing the government of Gothia destroyed. Set in a world of iron dirigibles and steam powered computers, this gothic horror mystery tells the story of Jasper Morello, a disgraced aerial navigator who flees his Plague-ridden home on a desperate voyage to redeem himself.Also winner of the Grand Prix award at the Annecy Animation Festival, Jasper has also won the top honours at the Canadian Film Centre&#x27;s Worldwide Short Film Festival, Best Animation at Flickerfest 2005, Best Animation at the Sydney Film Festival Dendy awards and Best Animation at Toronto worldwide shorts.</li><li class="mt-2">Uploaded by<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@monsterdistr..." class="text-cyan-600 underline">monsterdistr...</a></li></ul><details class="z-10 h-6"><summary>Stats for Nerds</summary><ul class="flex flex-col gap-2 bg-zinc-900 p-4 rounded-md border-red-700 border"><li>VideoId: <!-- -->vORsKyopHyM</li><li>Author username: <!-- -->monsterdistr...</li><li>Author display name at time of feature:<!-- --> <!-- -->monsterdistr...</li><li>Historical Author Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/monsterdistributes" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/user/monsterdistributes</a></li></ul></li><li>Historical Video Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vORsKyopHyM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vORsKyopHyM</a></li></ul></li><li>Wayback Homepage feature Links:<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081102013757/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20081102013757/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081103085914/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20081103085914/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081103132530/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20081103132530/http://youtube.com/</a></li></ul></li></ul></details></div><div class="flex gap-5 flex-col bg-zinc-900 rounded-md py-8 px-8 items-start border-red-700 border"><div class="flex gap-1 w-full place-content-between flex-col"><h5 class="bg-red-900 px-4 py-2 rounded-md whitespace-nowrap">Lowest Rated</h5><span class="whitespace-nowrap pl-4">2 Stars</span></div><div class="video-container rounded-md overflow-hidden"><iframe width="336" height="189" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b0S7LXH023M" title="YouTube video player - Hammer intros Soulja Boy &#x27;Bird Walk&#x27;
