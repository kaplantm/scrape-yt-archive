Abandoning a successful medical practice, he sought self-fulfillment by taking up the nomadic life of a surfer. But unlike other American searchers like Thoreau or Kerouac, Paskowitz took his wife and nine children along for the ride, all eleven of them living in a 24 foot camper. Together, they lived a life that would be unfathomable to most, but enviable to anyone who ever relinquished their dreams to a straight job. The Paskowitz Family proved that America may be running out of frontiers, but it hasn&#x27;t run out of frontiersman.For more info visit: http://www.surfwisefilm.com</li><li class="mt-2">Uploaded by<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@surfwisefilm" class="text-cyan-600 underline">surfwisefilm</a></li></ul><details class="z-10 h-6"><summary>Stats for Nerds</summary><ul class="flex flex-col gap-2 bg-zinc-900 p-4 rounded-md border-red-700 border"><li>VideoId: <!-- -->XmhxRVR9dqI</li><li>Author username: <!-- -->surfwisefilm</li><li>Author display name at time of feature:<!-- --> <!-- -->surfwisefilm</li><li>Historical Author Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/surfwisefilm" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/user/surfwisefilm</a></li></ul></li><li>Historical Video Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmhxRVR9dqI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmhxRVR9dqI</a></li></ul></li><li>Wayback Homepage feature Links:<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080515113814/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080515113814/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080515120726/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080515120726/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080515214523/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080515214523/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080516025246/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080516025246/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080517012106/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080517012106/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080517123222/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080517123222/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080517165829/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080517165829/http://youtube.com/</a></li></ul></li></ul></details></div><div class="flex gap-5 flex-col bg-zinc-900 rounded-md py-8 px-8 items-start border-red-700 border"><div class="flex gap-1 w-full place-content-between flex-col"><h5 class="bg-cyan-700 px-4 py-2 rounded-md whitespace-nowrap">Top Rated</h5><span class="whitespace-nowrap pl-4">5 Stars</span></div><div class="video-container rounded-md overflow-hidden"><iframe width="336" height="189" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SdckRgIDuI4" title="YouTube video player - Adventures in Masai Mara" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><ul class="w-full"><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdckRgIDuI4" class="font-lg font-bold underline">Adventures in Masai Mara</a></li><li class="max-h-20 overflow-auto">Located about 5 hours west of Nairobi, Masai Mara is the Kenya&#x27;s greatest park. The Mara is an extension of the Serengeti and covers over 1500sqkm. It contains a staggering amount of game especially during the annual wildebeest migration. There are no fences around the reserves in Kenya and Tanzania allowing the animals to roam freely in search of new grasses for grazing. The wildebeest migration is one of the few large movements of game in the world. The wildebeest give birth to their calves in the South East Serengeti then move into the Western Serengeti before heading north to Masai Mara in July.  They feed on the lush grasses of the Mara until October as the Serengeti plains are too dry. In December, the rains return to the Serengeti as does the migration.  There are 1.3 million wildebeest; 200,000 zebra; and 350,000 gazelles estimated in the migration.  Of course all the lions follow these animals making the Mara the most predator-packed reserve in the world. Cheetahs are very difficult to see in most African parks, but they are very easily seen here. Wildebeest can&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to drink as they cannot go longer than 5 days without water. They will risk life and limb to do so.  In the morning they might cross the croc- infested river only to re-cross the same river later in the afternoon. We camped for 16 days in the park at a community run Masai camp near Talek gate. We can&#x27;t wait to do it again!</li><li class="mt-2">Uploaded by<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cvillemac" class="text-cyan-600 underline">Cvillemac</a></li></ul><details class="z-10 h-6"><summary>Stats for Nerds</summary><ul class="flex flex-col gap-2 bg-zinc-900 p-4 rounded-md border-red-700 border"><li>VideoId: <!-- -->SdckRgIDuI4</li><li>Author username: <!-- -->Cvillemac</li><li>Author display name at time of feature:<!-- --> <!-- -->Cvillemac</li><li>Historical Author Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Cvillemac" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/user/Cvillemac</a></li></ul></li><li>Historical Video Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdckRgIDuI4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdckRgIDuI4</a></li></ul></li><li>Wayback Homepage feature Links:<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080530005608/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080530005608/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080531160258/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080531160258/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080602005357/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080602005357/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080602141408/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080602141408/http://youtube.com/</a></li></ul></li></ul></details></div><div class="flex gap-5 flex-col bg-zinc-900 rounded-md py-8 px-8 items-start border-red-700 border"><div class="flex gap-1 w-full place-content-between flex-col"><h5 class="bg-red-900 px-4 py-2 rounded-md whitespace-nowrap">Lowest Rated</h5><span class="whitespace-nowrap pl-4">1.5 Stars</span></div><div class="video-container rounded-md overflow-hidden"><iframe width="336" height="189" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ik01UEov8vg" title="YouTube video player - Little devil wanna play!" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><ul class="w-full"><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik01UEov8vg" class="font-lg font-bold underline">Little devil wanna play!</a></li><li class="max-h-20 overflow-auto">A weaponed baby devil is looking for friends...</li><li class="mt-2">Uploaded by<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@garciacity" class="text-cyan-600 underline">garciacity</a></li></ul><details class="z-10 h-6"><summary>Stats for Nerds</summary><ul class="flex flex-col gap-2 bg-zinc-900 p-4 rounded-md border-red-700 border"><li>VideoId: <!-- -->ik01UEov8vg</li><li>Author username: <!-- -->garciacity</li><li>Author display name at time of feature:<!-- --> <!-- -->garciacity</li><li>Historical Author Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/garciacity" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/user/garciacity</a></li></ul></li><li>Historical Video Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik01UEov8vg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik01UEov8vg</a></li></ul></li><li>Wayback Homepage feature Links:<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080526163804/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080526163804/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080526203520/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080526203520/http://youtube.com/</a></li></ul></li></ul></details></div><div class="flex gap-5 flex-col bg-zinc-900 rounded-md py-8 px-8 items-start border-red-700 border"><div class="flex gap-1 w-full place-content-between flex-col"><h5 class="bg-cyan-700 px-4 py-2 rounded-md whitespace-nowrap">Longest</h5><span class="whitespace-nowrap pl-4">00:25:34</span></div><div class="video-container rounded-md overflow-hidden"><iframe width="336" height="189" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3KfXlISY6L0" title="YouTube video player - Pangea Day: The First 20 Minutes" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><ul class="w-full"><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KfXlISY6L0" class="font-lg font-bold underline">Pangea Day: The First 20 Minutes</a></li><li class="max-h-20 overflow-auto">++ Join the discussion on PangeaDay.org ++Welcome to Pangea Day, from Desmond Tutu, Christian Amanpour, the hosts in LA, and Queen Noor.

The Mara is an extension of the Serengeti and covers over 1500sqkm. It contains a staggering amount of game especially during the annual wildebeest migration. There are no fences around the reserves in Kenya and Tanzania allowing the animals to roam freely in search of new grasses for grazing. The wildebeest migration is one of the few large movements of game in the world. The wildebeest give birth to their calves in the South East Serengeti then move into the Western Serengeti before heading north to Masai Mara in July.  They feed on the lush grasses of the Mara until October as the Serengeti plains are too dry. In December, the rains return to the Serengeti as does the migration.  There are 1.3 million wildebeest; 200,000 zebra; and 350,000 gazelles estimated in the migration.  Of course all the lions follow these animals making the Mara the most predator-packed reserve in the world. Cheetahs are very difficult to see in most African parks, but they are very easily seen here. Wildebeest can't pass up the opportunity to drink as they cannot go longer than 5 days without water.

The Mara is an extension of the Serengeti and covers over 1500sqkm. It contains a staggering amount of game especially during the annual wildebeest migration. There are no fences around the reserves in Kenya and Tanzania allowing the animals to roam freely in search of new grasses for grazing. The wildebeest migration is one of the few large movements of game in the world. The wildebeest give birth to their calves in the South East Serengeti then move into the Western Serengeti before heading north to Masai Mara in July.  They feed on the lush grasses of the Mara until October as the Serengeti plains are too dry. In December, the rains return to the Serengeti as does the migration.  There are 1.3 million wildebeest; 200,000 zebra; and 350,000 gazelles estimated in the migration.  Of course all the lions follow these animals making the Mara the most predator-packed reserve in the world. Cheetahs are very difficult to see in most African parks, but they are very easily seen here. Wildebeest can't pass up the opportunity to drink as they cannot go longer than 5 days without water.
