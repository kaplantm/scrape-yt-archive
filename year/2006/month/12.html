And since some questions keeps coming up, i thought I&#x27;d answer them. The video took two months to shoot and edit, and I edited it in Final Cut Pro. Nothing in the video is &quot;fake&quot; and we definitely didn&#x27;t use any green screens or after effects or anything. I really am responding to every message, but it appears as if half of them arent going through. Sorry!Download the music here!
