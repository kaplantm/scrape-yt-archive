&quot;Chocolate Rain&quot;

Chocolate Rain
Some stay dry and others feel the pain
Chocolate Rain
A baby born will die before the sin

Chocolate Rain
The school books say it can&#x27;t be here again
Chocolate Rain
The prisons make you wonder where it went

Chocolate Rain
Build a tent and say the world is dry
Chocolate Rain
Zoom the camera out and see the lie 

Chocolate Rain
Forecast to be falling yesterday
Chocolate Rain
Only in the past is what they say

Chocolate Rain
Raised your neighborhood insurance rates
Chocolate Rain
Makes us happy &#x27;livin in a gate

Chocolate Rain
Made me cross the street the other day
Chocolate Rain
Made you turn your head the other way

(Chorus)
Chocolate Rain
History quickly crashing through your veins
Chocolate Rain
Using you to fall back down again
[Repeat]

Chocolate Rain
Seldom mentioned on the radio
Chocolate Rain
Its the fear your leaders call control

Chocolate Rain
Worse than swearing worse than calling names
Chocolate Rain
Say it publicly and you&#x27;re insane

Chocolate Rain
No one wants to hear about it now
Chocolate Rain
Wish real hard it goes away somehow

Chocolate Rain
Makes the best of friends begin to fight
Chocolate Rain
But did they know each other in the light? 

Chocolate Rain
Every February washed away
Chocolate Rain
Stays behind as colors celebrate

Chocolate Rain
The same crime has a higher price to pay
chocolate Rain
The judge and jury swear it&#x27;s not the face

(Chorus)

Chocolate Rain
Dirty secrets of economy
Chocolate Rain
Turns that body into GDP 

Chocolate Rain
The bell curve blames the baby&#x27;s DNA
Chocolate Rain
But test scores are how much the parents make

Chocolate Rain
&#x27;Flippin cars in France the other night
Chocolate Rain
Cleans the sewers out beneath Mumbai

Chocolate Rain
&#x27;Cross the world and back its all the same
Chocolate Rain
Angels cry and shake their heads in shame

Chocolate Rain
Lifts the ark of paradise in sin
Chocolate Rain
Which part do you think you&#x27;re &#x27;livin in?

Chocolate Rain
More than &#x27;marchin more than passing law
Chocolate Rain
Remake how we got to where we are.

Synopsis: Harold Buttleman (John Hawkes, &#x27;Deadwood&#x27;) is a small town tuxedo salesman who thinks he&#x27;s the next Evel Knievel. He is on the brink of TV stardom (a 3 a.m. spot on late night cable access), but the life of a daredevil stuntman is harder than it looks. Harold&#x27;s parents want him to move out of their basement and his girlfriend wants him to settle into a career selling bathtub parts.

For Harold, it all depends on his big break - he gathers the entire town for his gala premiere celebration, but there&#x27;s a surprise in store. An offbeat comedy about following your dreams, and the finer points of being shot out of a cannon. Also stars Anita Barone, Stephen Falk (&#x27;God, Inc&#x27;), Stephanie Jane Markham (&#x27;God, Inc&#x27;), Karen Black (&#x27;Easy Rider&#x27;) and Dan Castellaneta (&#x27;The Simpsons&#x27;).

Thanks a lot for checking out our movie!

He is on the brink of TV stardom (a 3 a.m. spot on late night cable access), but the life of a daredevil stuntman is harder than it looks.

An offbeat comedy about following your dreams, and the finer points of being shot out of a cannon. Also stars Anita Barone, Stephen Falk ('God, Inc'), Stephanie Jane Markham ('God, Inc'), Karen Black ('Easy Rider') and Dan Castellaneta ('The Simpsons').\n\nThanks a lot for checking out our movie!
