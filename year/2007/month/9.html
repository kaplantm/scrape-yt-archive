Darfur, Sudan is being called the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. Tens of thousands of people have died. Two million more have been forced to flee their homes and livelihoods. For these innocent civilians, living on the edge of survival, their only hope is the dwindling number of humanitarian organizations willing to risk the dangers on the ground in Darfur to provide relief.  International Medical Corps was one of the first relief organizations to arrive on the scene in Darfur, and remains there to this day.  Established in 1984 by volunteer doctors and nurses, IMC provides help in more than 25 countries and regions worldwide that have been ravaged by war and disaster. IMC&#x27;s network of some 5,000 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals makes it one of the fastest, most effective emergency response agencies in the world.  In Darfur, IMC has been providing critical emergency medical services to a target population of about 300,000. This includes operating seven primary health care centers and two mobile clinics aimed at improving access to health care, nutritional assistance, and clean water and sanitation. These facilities provide family medicine; pre-natal, maternal, and child health care; immunizations; referrals and transportation for secondary care; and health and hygiene education. IMC also has rehabilitated local health care facilities, providing medicines, supplies and health care training to local professionals.  For more information visit http://www.imcworldwide.org.

Parental warning: Contains (very tasteful) nudity.

Six hundred people shed their clothes on a glacier in the Swiss Alps to bodily cry out for help against a planetary emergency: global warming.

The nude volunteers posed for us and renowned naked &quot;installation&quot; artist Spencer Tunick on the Aletsch Glacier.

Without clothes, the human body is vulnerable, exposed, its life or death at the whim of the elements. Global warming is stripping away our glaciers and leaving our entire planet vulnerable to extreme weather, floods, sea-level rise, global decreases in carrying capacity and agricultural production, fresh water shortages, disease and mass human dislocations.

If global warming continues at its current rate, most glaciers in Switzerland will completely disappear by 2080, leaving nothing but valleys and slopes strewn with rock debris.</li><li class="mt-2">Uploaded by<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@GreenpeaceVideo" class="text-cyan-600 underline">GreenpeaceVideo</a></li></ul><details class="z-10 h-6"><summary>Stats for Nerds</summary><ul class="flex flex-col gap-2 bg-zinc-900 p-4 rounded-md border-red-700 border"><li>VideoId: <!-- -->0RVp8Q6H9e0</li><li>Author username: <!-- -->GreenpeaceVideo</li><li>Author display name at time of feature:<!-- --> <!-- -->GreenpeaceVideo</li><li>Historical Author Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GreenpeaceVideo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/user/GreenpeaceVideo</a></li></ul></li><li>Historical Video Links:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RVp8Q6H9e0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RVp8Q6H9e0</a></li></ul></li><li>Wayback Homepage feature Links:<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070914220233/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20070914220233/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070915220145/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20070915220145/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080624083103/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080624083103/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080625193704/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080625193704/http://youtube.com/</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080625204529/http://youtube.com/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20080625204529/http://youtube.com/</a></li></ul></li></ul></details></div><div class="flex gap-5 flex-col bg-zinc-900 rounded-md py-8 px-8 items-start border-red-700 border"><div class="flex gap-1 w-full place-content-between flex-col"><h5 class="bg-cyan-700 px-4 py-2 rounded-md whitespace-nowrap">Most Often Featured</h5><span class="whitespace-nowrap pl-4">Featured 9 Days</span></div><div class="video-container rounded-md overflow-hidden"><iframe width="336" height="189" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_z0-Q-C8Xb0" title="YouTube video player - The Brunettes - Her Hairagami Set" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><ul class="w-full"><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z0-Q-C8Xb0" class="font-lg font-bold underline">The Brunettes - Her Hairagami Set</a></li><li class="max-h-20 overflow-auto">This is a video for the song &quot;Her Hairagami Set&quot; from The Brunettes 2007 album &quot;Structure &amp; Cosmetics&quot;.
