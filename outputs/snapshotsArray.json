The footage here is raw. I wanted to approximate the feel of the event.

Enjoy the video, sorry I wanted to show all, but YouTube only allow 100 MB max, and my Video exceeded that, compressing the video only made the quality really bad, so it's best this way.

This year no Cannon Gun was fired by the infamous Tam the Gun, in real life known as, Staff Sergeant Thomas McKay, known as Tam the Gun, died at his home early on Thursday morning, 17th November 2005 at the age of 60. He had been suffering from cancer. :-( So for the first Scottish New Year in many years there was no gun fired on the hour chime, Tam's whisky lay waiting on top on the Cannon, and a lone piper played as the Fireworks went off as a mark of respect to Tam. He will be sadly missed here. But we still had the best Hogmanay (New years Eve) party in the world, as always we Scots know how to hold a party,people come here every New year from all over Europe and the rest of the world just for the all night party, we are a proud nation and we keep our traditions and heritage, and are proud of it. Enjoy the video, sorry I wanted to show all, but YouTube only allow 100 MB max, and my Video exceeded that, compressing the video only made the quality really bad, so it's best this way.

Produced by revered pop craftsman Richard X. Heyman with Nancy Leigh and Spiff Wiegand and mixed by Kurt Reil of the Gripweeds, REDBEARD combines the genre-defying musicality of The Band, the earthy sincerity of Wilco and The Jayhawks, and the quirky pop smarts of Ben Folds Five and Guster for a welcome respite from the irony, detachment and jadedness found in much of today's new music. THE RANDY BANDITS will be hosting a CD Release Party for REDBEARD Friday, Feb. 17 in the Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard St., New York City. Show time is 8 p.m., with Byron Isaacs of Ollabelle and Tom Warnick opening. Tickets $10. Info: 212-219-3132 or www.knittingfactory.com.  REDBEARD encapsulates THE RANDY BANDITS' quest to put out new music in an entertaining way, to captivate fans (a.k.a. Fandits) with sincerity as well as lunacy, and to do something meaningful in a culture and business currently deluged with artifice and irony. The songs on REDBEARD swing from Rock to Country to Bluegrass to Jazz to Soul to Blues to Gospel with lots of hybrids, a jillion instruments traded amongst the musicians, and soaring vocal harmonies. The band's lyrics reflect the sensibility of their leader, award-winning playwright-turned-songwriter Jim Knable (\"Spain\"), who sings, plays acoustic guitar and sax, and is joined in THE RANDY BANDITS by Russ Kaplan (keyboards, vocals), Stephen Aleman (vocals, percussion), Spiff Wiegand (vocals, trumpet, mandolin, electric guitar, accordion and more), Chris Murphy (bass, vocals, electric guitar) and Adam Farrell (drums).  Together, they've focused attention to arrangement and performance since THE RANDY BANDITS' 2003 EP, The Woman ... or the Blues. The folky abandon has been left behind, but the spontaneity and downright madness their audiences love remains in full force.  We're sincere musical adventurers who believe in connecting to our audience with fun, humor and humanity,\" says Knable. \"We're not ironic. We're not about pop culture trendiness. We're about making really lasting music.\"  REDBEARD is available through www.randybandits.com, www.cdbaby.com, www.amazon.com and exclusively in Manhattan at The Mudtruck on Wall Street and in Brooklyn at Soundtracks on 7th Ave.","tags":["randy","bandits","knitting","factory","red","beard","music","EPK","mudtruck","brooklyn","story","of","your","life","capella","Music"],"views":1,"author":"therandybandits","videoId":"vTVcB5BxO1Y","comments":10,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1139452529000,"dateFeatured":"Thu, 09 Feb 2006 02:35:29 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20060209023529","age":"3 days ago","categories":["Entertainment"],"duration":147,"stars":4.5},{"title":"Pilot's eye view of a three day trip","description":"I made this video for my daughter to see where it is that I work.

That is why they're there at the wildlife hospital...and because of that they are not capable of kicking a butt or wat did u say?? asses??? they can't attack people...and they are also well-behaved kangaroos...and to those who say It's boring to take video in a Zoo well..for me its not a Zoo just to display animals...IT'S A SANCTUARYS.. meaning \"HOLY\" It's a consecrative place..has a sacred purpose with Tranquility and Security...and also giv people a chance to have a face to face with them...wake up man!There are no places on earth that are not altered by man..It would be unbearable to think of a world in which the most majestic of the creatures of the land are no longer existed...Lucky we have sanctuaries to care and preserve them...","tags":["catch","you","scratch","Entertainment","Music"],"views":52,"author":"judiii","videoId":"NwfPdDrDLtE","comments":134,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1141982367000,"dateFeatured":"Fri, 10 Mar 2006 09:19:27 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20060310091927","age":"1 day ago","categories":["Arts & Animation"],"duration":63,"stars":3.5},{"title":"Loggers Sports","description":"Cable racing in Western Canada's premier loggers sports venue, Squamish British Columbia.

Here she climbs onto my fingers and enjoys a snack of honey.  Note: This is not a Japanese giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia), but a Vespa ducalis, which comes really close in size. It is not a male, as someone claimed, it's a worker. Note the antennae and abdomen - males have an additional segment and a blunt abdomen, and long curved antennae. Their usual lifespan is merely several weeks, which is why I'm surprised myself. She isn't flying simply because she's busy eating. I caught her intending just to take some photos, but decided to keep her later. This is not in any way related to the cicada killer, it is a close relative of the European hornet Vespa crabro and the previously mentioned Japanese giant hornet. They never attack away from the nest. And yes, I have been stung by this species (but not this individual); it hurts somewhat; swollen hand, stiff fingers, but no lasting effect. She died naturally of old age.

Holy balls, this one took a while to finish, mainly because of the size. It clocked in as a whole gig when I had it as an .AVI.  This is the \"Battle of Wits\" scene from The Princess Bride. A mysterious man in black has been chasing three criminals who have kidnapped a princess. He has beaten a swordsman and a giant.

Holy balls, this one took a while to finish, mainly because of the size. It clocked in as a whole gig when I had it as an .AVI.  This is the \"Battle of Wits\" scene from The Princess Bride. A mysterious man in black has been chasing three criminals who have kidnapped a princess. He has beaten a swordsman and a giant. Now all that's left is outsmarting the genius of the group, Vizzini, in a battle of wits. ------------------------------ -------------- RECENT QUESTIONS AND STATEMENTS ANSWERED:  Yes, that is my actual voice. (Wtf?)  Yes, I realize that there is a glaring continuity error, and I hit myself for not noticing it. I didn't go back and fix it for two reasons:  1. I didn't feel like it. 2. It was only a small continuity error, and I'm not trying to focus on getting the scene picture perfect to the original. I'm focusing on the acting and dialogue.  I know I fell the wrong way. There was a desk to my right. I would have collided with it. ------------------------------ --------------  Here's a list of what I used, and what they were supposed to represent in the scene.  My mask = a pair of boxers with holes cut in them My moustache = a brown-colored toothpick scotch-taped to my face Wine = Iced tea Wine bottle = a tupperware container The Princess (scene briefly on the right of the screen near the beginning) = a rocking horse with a red shirt on it  Five minutes long... this is definitely the longest one.
