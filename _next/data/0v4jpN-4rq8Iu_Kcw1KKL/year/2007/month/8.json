Harold Buttleman, small town tuxedo salesman, thinks he's the next Evel Knievel. He's not.\n\nNow you can help support my projects - I get a dollar for everyone who joins Spout (it's free!)- http://www.spout.com/francisst okes\nYou can buy DVDs here: http://www.customflix.com/2336 33\n\nSynopsis: Harold Buttleman (John Hawkes, 'Deadwood') is a small town tuxedo salesman who thinks he's the next Evel Knievel. He is on the brink of TV stardom (a 3 a.m. spot on late night cable access), but the life of a daredevil stuntman is harder than it looks. Harold's parents want him to move out of their basement and his girlfriend wants him to settle into a career selling bathtub parts.\n\nFor Harold, it all depends on his big break - he gathers the entire town for his gala premiere celebration, but there's a surprise in store. An offbeat comedy about following your dreams, and the finer points of being shot out of a cannon. Also stars Anita Barone, Stephen Falk ('God, Inc'), Stephanie Jane Markham ('God, Inc'), Karen Black ('Easy Rider') and Dan Castellaneta ('The Simpsons').\n\nThanks a lot for checking out our movie!
