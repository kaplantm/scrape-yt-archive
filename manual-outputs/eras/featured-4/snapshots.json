I don't know how it broke like that but with the ice breaker and our ship coming through, it some how broke into that square shape.  We were on our way to Antarctica to resupply McMurdo Station, a scientific research base down there when the ice became too thick for us to make it through.  We waited nearly three weeks for an ice breaker to make the ice channel wide enough for us to go through, and during that time I had the opportunity to climb down on the ice and walk around.\n\t\t...

Please read on...I received a lot of emails about my new videos in the last couple of days. So here are some general comments:Important: PhoneCam Magic tricks are not real magic - they are just fun short puzzles for you to solve. If they entertain you or even fool you the first time you watch them than let me know. :-)About me: I am a professional magician and travel the world performing mostly on television and for large corporations (You will find examples of my work on my profile page). These new \"PhoneCam Magic\" videos are my new hobby and I to produce them in my spare time.For those of you who want to try it yourself, here are the rules I obey in this project:PhoneCam Magic Manifest:1. The magic has to be shoot in a single continues take. Pausing of the camera is not permitted.2. Any post processing, editing, trimming is not permitted.3. The sound must never be post-produced apart from the images or vice versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the magic is being shot). 4. The camera must be hand- held by the magician for the start and the end of the movie. Handing off, placing down or mounting of the camera is permitted. 5. Special lighting is not acceptable unless it is shown to the audience as part of the magic plot. (If there is too little light for exposure a single lamp can be attached to the camera/phone.) 6. Optical work and filters are forbidden unless they are shown to the audience and part of the magic plot. 7. The movie format must be digital.8. The magic must be all original to best knowledge of the creator/magician. Marketed tricks or other magician's material is not permitted.Thanks again for all your comments and to youtube for making this a featured item !Marco\n\t\t...

I then either made sure it was set to video or switched my digital camera to movie mode and hit record.  The physical confrontation seemed to begin immediately after that and I quickly moved toward the stage to document the already surreal setting we were all quickly lost in.  According to police, the officer asked that the music be turned down, was attacked and used his Taser in self-defense.  I find it hard to imagine anyone out of the supposed 140+ in attendance who witnessed the incident would agree things occurred the way the officer described them.I spent the better part of a day in jail because of that crazy cop.Though it should have been the officer and not me behind bars, let us not forget that one 'bad cop' doesn't mean they all are -- though there are certainly others.  The male/female officers who drove Andrew and me downtown were pretty cool.  One guard at the jail in particular had a number of inmates laughing at times and seemed to have a great solution for dealing with the out-of-control fool in cell 2 who flooded the place with toilet water.Were you there?

Sorry folks.]A reading of the poem by Robert W. Service (Jan. 16, 1874 - Sept. 11, 1958).Most people reading this poem treat it as lightweight fare, a funny parody of a horror story.

The climactic stanza is hilarious, not scary.  I'll rely on you folks to tell me if I succeeded.Once again, folks who like their poems read as though they were songs, adhering tightly to their rhythmic structure, will be disappointed.

Well virtually everyone on youtube wants to be a celebrity. Don't think so? Ask yourself this, if someone wanted to interview  you about  your channel, would you be interviewed? And why? To get more people knowing about you? To get more subscriptions? I think the answer for most people would be yes to these questions.So just because someone wants to be a celebrity, do they deserve to be made fun of? Well with fame, comes many challenges. One of which is to deal with ridicule and those who might not like you. If you can't handle being made fun of, you shouldn't crave fame.Now having said this, how can you contribute to youtube without being ridiculed? Well the answer is quite obvious. Don't say stupid things (unless of course you're joking around).Remember there is a cure for stupidity. If you don't want to be made fun of, go read a book, read the newspaper, educate yourself. Otherwise, you just might end up on YOUTUBEtheater.

Well virtually everyone on youtube wants to be a celebrity. Don't think so? Ask yourself this, if someone wanted to interview  you about  your channel, would you be interviewed? And why? To get more people knowing about you? To get more subscriptions? I think the answer for most people would be yes to these questions.So just because someone wants to be a celebrity, do they deserve to be made fun of? Well with fame, comes many challenges. One of which is to deal with ridicule and those who might not like you. If you can't handle being made fun of, you shouldn't crave fame.Now having said this, how can you contribute to youtube without being ridiculed? Well the answer is quite obvious. Don't say stupid things (unless of course you're joking around).Remember there is a cure for stupidity. If you don't want to be made fun of, go read a book, read the newspaper, educate yourself.

When the pieces are open and there are two exposed ends, these ends are very strong and can easily attach to any nearby metal. However when the ends are closed the magnetic field is contained within the magnets themselves and very little residual force exists outside of the piece preventing it from simply coming off near any metallic objects.Concerns about computers hard drive:To affect your computer, a magnetic field has to exceed the coercively of the magnetic coating on the storage device. Hard drives have a coercively of a few thousand Oersteds, which means a field of the same number of Gauss is needed to demagnetize them. The magnetic field strength falls off with the cube of the distance, and even 3x the strength of ours can't wipe a hard drive if they're not touching it. Besides when worn the majority of the magnetic field will be constrained inside the circle.Health concerns... Iron in Blood:Iron atoms in a magnet are crammed together in a solid state about one atom apart from one another. In your blood only four iron atoms are allocated to each hemoglobin molecule, and they are separated by distances too great to form a magnet. This is easily tested by pricking your finger and placing a drop of your blood next to a magnet. - By Michael Shermer SCIENTIFIC AMERICANIf you have other FAQ's like credit cards, cell phones etc please see my FAQ page:http://www.dynomighty.com/faq.phpThanks,Terrence\n\t\t\t(more)\n\t\t\t(less)","tags":["dynomighty","magnetic","bracelet","jewelry","magnet","rare","earth"],"views":975889,"author":"","videoId":"Pf3z935R37E","comments":null,"stars":2.5,"numRatings":3486,"age":"1 month ago","dateFeaturedEpoch":1167163820000,"dateFeatured":"Tue, 26 Dec 2006 20:10:20 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20061226201020","categories":["Science & Technology"]},{"title":"US State Capitals","duration":152,"description":"A preschool kid trying to remember the state capitals of USA.","tags":["Smart","Kid","StateCapitals","Maadhu","Tamizh","Tamil"],"views":606809,"author":"","videoId":"RIH1I1doUI4","comments":null,"stars":2.5,"numRatings":3311,"age":"2 months ago","dateFeaturedEpoch":1167163820000,"dateFeatured":"Tue, 26 Dec 2006 20:10:20 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20061226201020","categories":["Travel & Places"]}]},"2006122722":{"timestamp":"20061227222717","checked":"FOUND","eraName":"FEATURED_4","featuredVideos":[{"title":"Sun Tzu and mom on The Farm","duration":28,"description":"Sun Tzu and mom on The Farm","tags":["sun","tzu","mom","farm","machine","gun","funny","wheelchair"],"views":64968,"author":"","videoId":"Ytbei8Dm-n4","comments":null,"stars":2.5,"numRatings":419,"age":"1 week ago","dateFeaturedEpoch":1167258437000,"dateFeatured":"Wed, 27 Dec 2006 22:27:17 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20061227222717","categories":["People"]},{"title":"Welcome To The YouTube Nation","duration":250,"description":"I think that YouTube is changing the world.

I assembled a team of 20 animators to assist me, including co-workers, as well as students from my 3D character animation class at the Art Institute of California-San Francisco. We created more than four minutes of animation in just three months. When it was completed, I surprised Natasha by bringing her to the Parkway Movie Theater in Oakland, where they played the animation on the big screen in front of over 100 of our friends and family. The entire event was filmed for the TLC television show \"A Perfect Proposal.\"Director's Note: I pulled a George Lucas and retrofitted the opening shot of the animation to show a photo of the Natasha design from \"The Invitation\" rather than the earlier drawing of Natsha I had done, which I was never quite satisfied with. Also, after receiving many a tersely written emails, I finally decided to listen to the fans and have completely removed all scenes with Jar Jar Binks.\n\t\t\t(more)\n\t\t\t(less)","tags":["3d","animation","engaged","jeff","natasha","shmoopie","romantic","marry","wedding","tlc","love","short","comedy","moulin","rouge","perfect","proposal","cg"],"views":194964,"author":"","videoId":"Syxwkc36jas","comments":null,"stars":2.5,"numRatings":3060,"age":"4 months ago","dateFeaturedEpoch":1167508301000,"dateFeatured":"Sat, 30 Dec 2006 19:51:41 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20061230195141","categories":["Arts & Animation"]},{"title":"...and then I woke up, horrified!","duration":387,"description":"3 animated nightmaresfor a better quality version go to sthmonster.googlepages.com","tags":["skeleton","nightmares","dream","monsters","neurotransmitters","serotonin","neurons","science"],"views":325258,"author":"","videoId":"SC7QBo2a4hQ","comments":null,"stars":2.5,"numRatings":1491,"age":"2 months ago","dateFeaturedEpoch":1167508301000,"dateFeatured":"Sat, 30 Dec 2006 19:51:41 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20061230195141","categories":["Arts & Animation"]},{"title":"another original Esmée Song : Anything is possible","duration":61,"description":"....","tags":["Esmée","esmeedenters","music"],"views":844795,"author":"","videoId":"vLZcmrdfV9c","comments":null,"stars":2.5,"numRatings":3285,"age":"5 days ago","dateFeaturedEpoch":1167508301000,"dateFeatured":"Sat, 30 Dec 2006 19:51:41 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20061230195141","categories":["Music"]},{"title":"The Machinegun Opera","duration":100,"description":"A film done for the \"48 Hour Lockdown\" here at Calarts.

A 48 hour lockdown is when we pick a weekend to just sit down and finish some sort of film in under 48 hours, usually centered around some sort of random subject. This lockdown took place before Holloween 2006 and happened to center around \"tube socks\" by some random draw of the hat. When I was sitting around trying to think of what kind of movie I could make about tube socks, I just figured \"THESE TUBE SOCKS, THEY NEED TO GO ON AN ADVENTURE.\"And so, here is The Machinegun Opera.Advertisement chance: Visit my website!http://persona.mechafetus.comEDIT:Thanks to rockman Brandon @ insert credit, my video has been Kotakued amongst other things.

The young man who joined the army did so of his own free will. He was 20 years old and his parents played no part in his decision to serve his country. They are proud to have such a brave son. I am only the best friend (for 34 years) of the mother, Cindy. It is my honor to post this video on YouTube. All of the wonderful messages that I have received are being forwarded to Heather and her mother.Heather loves to sing. Since she was small she has always tried to get to the microphone first at church so she could sing. She always loved karaoke and would beg for the mic. She still loves singing more than just about anything. Heather loves her brother and misses him. She has many memories of him. He comes home every chance he gets and will probably get to come home for a short time in February or March.Before I truned on the camera Heather was really acting silly and laughing. What many of you have said looks like crying at the first is just Heather rubbing her eyes like any 6 year old might do.end edit6 year old Heather Martin sings a song that her mother wrote for her Brother Shaun who is serving in Iraq. The song is written from Heather's point of view.LyricsYou were almost sixteen when I came into the world.Mom and Dad had you first then 3 more boys I'm the baby girl.I sure have a lot to look up to in you, you're really smart and funny with a big heart too.After one year of college you knew what you had to do. It's just like you wanting to help with the war.So you joined the army when I was only 4.This time of year we talk of big plans but you're over seas in some distant land.You can't be here for Christmas, I don't understand. Chorus:When are you coming home, Shaun?When are you coming home?!We lit up the house like we always do but it doesn't seem bright 'cause we can't have you.In my prayers I ask God to keep you safe.And I'm trying to be really brave.Tell me that the fighting's through. Come home!I really miss you. It's hard to enjoy the holidays without you.But we're so proud of you and all the red white and blue.Remember that Jesus is your best friend,And someday our families will be together again.Wow! You know we'll have a great big party then.ChorusI want to show you how tall I've grown and introduce you to my new friends at school.Maybe we could go and get some ice cream together but I really don't care what we do.Chorus\n\t\t\t(more)\n\t\t\t(less)","tags":["Heather","Martin","Iraq","Troops","Shaun","Song","Music","Original","Piano","Composition","Army","Christmas","Child","Singing","tribute"],"views":1272,"author":"","videoId":"eVFF98kNg8Q","comments":null,"stars":2.5,"numRatings":8340,"age":"1 month ago","dateFeaturedEpoch":1167508301000,"dateFeatured":"Sat, 30 Dec 2006 19:51:41 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20061230195141","categories":["People"]},{"title":"NO Boundaries","duration":67,"description":"A little stop motion animation I made for the company I work for.
