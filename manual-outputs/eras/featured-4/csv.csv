		I thought Keegan was going to be taking pictures of the killer whales, so I tried posing with them at the edge of the ice.  Instead I got this video.  The water was so clear we could see the whales underwater before they surfaced.  When Keegan walks up to the edge of the ice at the end of the video you can see one of the whales underwater just before it surfaces.  And no, we did not cut out the hole in the ice.  I don't know how it broke like that but with the ice breaker and our ship coming through, it some how broke into that square shape.  We were on our way to Antarctica to resupply McMurdo Station, a scientific research base down there when the ice became too thick for us to make it through.  We waited nearly three weeks for an ice breaker to make the ice channel wide enough for us to go through, and during that time I had the opportunity to climb down on the ice and walk around.

The fish was about 5 feet long and looked quite confident in his ability to defend his territory.  Check out those teeth!

		Comedian/Actor Brian Posehn recently completed work on his first music video     The video, for POSEHN (Brian's metal band) track ""Metal By Numbers"" taken from Brian's upcoming CD 'Live In: Nerd Rage', www.BriansNerdRage.com was shot on location in Los Angeles, CA with the team of director Darren Doane (DEFTONES, AFI), producer Jeremy Jackson and editor Dan Dobi. The video illustrates Brian's view on today's metal scene and features appearances from POSEHN members Scott Ian (ANTHRAX / DAMNOCRACY) and Joey Vera (ARMORED SAINT/FATES WARNING).     The video can be viewed exclusively at Brian's MySpace page: www.myspace.com/BrianPosehn as part of Brian's stint as the featured comedian this week (7/3 -- 7/9/06) on MySpace Comedy.

Recorded as part of Brian's appearances on the Comedians of Comedy tour, and including a sketch with Bob Odenkirk (Mr. Show), 'Live In: Nerd Rage' is Brian at his funniest. 'Live In: Nerd Rage' will be released on July 11th in North America, with an international release to follow in August.

Been off on holiday (not quite as dramatic this time - Portnoo in Donegal on the North-West coast of Ireland. Look it up!) and came back to about half a million views and over 2000 comments!Also, didn't expect to start a debate on creationism vs. evolution (evolution by the way!) or quite so many racist comments!!  And to all you racist folks, just what is it that brings you to such distorted view of people/life/the world?Anyway, hope you enjoy this!Paddy

		Thank you all for stopping by. Please read on...I received a lot of emails about my new videos in the last couple of days. So here are some general comments:Important: PhoneCam Magic tricks are not real magic - they are just fun short puzzles for you to solve. If they entertain you or even fool you the first time you watch them than let me know. :-)About me: I am a professional magician and travel the world performing mostly on television and for large corporations (You will find examples of my work on my profile page). These new ""PhoneCam Magic"" videos are my new hobby and I to produce them in my spare time.For those of you who want to try it yourself, here are the rules I obey in this project:PhoneCam Magic Manifest:1. The magic has to be shoot in a single continues take. Pausing of the camera is not permitted.2. Any post processing, editing, trimming is not permitted.3. The sound must never be post-produced apart from the images or vice versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the magic is being shot). 4. The camera must be hand- held by the magician for the start and the end of the movie. Handing off, placing down or mounting of the camera is permitted. 5. Special lighting is not acceptable unless it is shown to the audience as part of the magic plot. (If there is too little light for exposure a single lamp can be attached to the camera/phone.) 6. Optical work and filters are forbidden unless they are shown to the audience and part of the magic plot. 7. The movie format must be digital.8. The magic must be all original to best knowledge of the creator/magician. Marketed tricks or other magician's material is not permitted.Thanks again for all your comments and to youtube for making this a featured item !Marco

Beginning in April 1968 Martin changed the bridge plate. This seriously affected the sound quality and may help explain why old Martins sound so much better than newer ones.

		Ok, here it is! The greatest impression video of all time, I challenge anyone else to match it!  I have done 48-50 impressions in less than 10 minutes.  And I think they are pretty decent impressions as well.  Well, you'll just have to watch and see.  Basically I've been seeing some impression videos lately being featured on YouTube, and I thought Artie's was pretty good but the other one featured recently sucked and made me want to showcase how real impressions are done.  Anyway, they're not all spot on but pretty close.

			Sometimes, a hug is all what we need. Free hugs is a real life controversial story of Juan Mann, A man whos sole mission was to reach out and hug a stranger to brighten up their lives. In this age of social disconnectivity and lack of human contact, the effects of the Free Hugs campaign became phenomenal.As this symbol of human hope spread accross the city, police and officials ordered the Free Hugs campaign BANNED. What we then witness is the true spirit of humanity come together in what can only be described as awe inspiring.In the Spirit of the free hugs campaign, PASS THIS TO A FRIEND and HUG A STRANGER! After all, If you can reach just one person...Music by Sick Puppies. (Visit http://sickpuppies.net or http://myspace.com/sickpuppies for the music)

			The following video was taken with a TothTelescope ( http://www.tothtelescope.com ) a revolutionary new telescope system. The TothTelescope is a multi function monocular system that is capable of 1. microscopy work up to 500x; 2. terrestrial observation where you can view people's face from 3 kilometers; 3. and it can also take images of the moon as shown in this video - all from a telescope that is only 500 grams in weight and measures only 14 cm in length. Incredible little telescope. This video shows the moon crossing the telescope's field of view and then suddenly, at the 2:05 mark, a jet plane crosses. Unbelievable one in a million shot. It was not orchestrated. Pure coincidence. NOTE: In response to all who made a comment. What is so special about this. The fact that a small telescope took this picture at a magnification of approximately 100x, and in that small field of view a plane crossed. This is not the same thing as you looking up at the moon and a plane comes by. Look how big the moon is. Fills the entire field of view!

			edit: ""Redbull Art of Can"" was open for any entry inspired/ using their cans. It took me a week sketching for a rythm (since all the sounds where in the same frequency range..)After that I had three days film and edit the video. The first 20 seconds of cans dropping took 6 hours to edit. And I continued like that editing nonstop for three days. On the third day without any sleep I started to go a bit mad, but managed to send of the entry to myself! Puzzled, I decided to post it on YouTube, where it somehow got featured. This is not a commercial, nor am I a Shill, ""Gay"" or with too much free time on my hands.

			Great concert cut short: A few songs into Two Gallants' set at Walter's on Washington in Houston, an officer appeared on stage very near the mic.  I then either made sure it was set to video or switched my digital camera to movie mode and hit record.  The physical confrontation seemed to begin immediately after that and I quickly moved toward the stage to document the already surreal setting we were all quickly lost in.  According to police, the officer asked that the music be turned down, was attacked and used his Taser in self-defense.  I find it hard to imagine anyone out of the supposed 140+ in attendance who witnessed the incident would agree things occurred the way the officer described them.I spent the better part of a day in jail because of that crazy cop.Though it should have been the officer and not me behind bars, let us not forget that one 'bad cop' doesn't mean they all are -- though there are certainly others.  The male/female officers who drove Andrew and me downtown were pretty cool.  One guard at the jail in particular had a number of inmates laughing at times and seemed to have a great solution for dealing with the out-of-control fool in cell 2 who flooded the place with toilet water.Were you there? To file a formal complaint I understand it might be best to do so with the Harris Co. D.A. Public Integrity Division.

			PLEASE READ THESE NOTES AUDIENCE MEMBERS traveling at a liver killing speed through european cities.Notes regarding some of the comments:-I attempted my own version of a scene from a movie I own, Rules of Attraction, directed by Roger Avary based on a hilarious book by Brett Easton Ellis. I just liked the idea and decided to edit something similiar with my hours of footage. Something to quickly show people. -I have lived in Europe for more than half my life, I greatly appreciate the culture and history, but this was the first time i was allotted time there without my parents, and i hadn't seen my friends in 3 years, so because i had already been to all the museums, all the bridges, libararies, etc, I decided to hit up the activities I wasn't completely prepared for as a high schooler. - got laid. But you can't bring cameras into the red light districts, brothels, etc.

			[UPDATE:  I'm not accepting video responses to this video.  Sorry folks.]A reading of the poem by Robert W. Service (Jan. 16, 1874 - Sept. 11, 1958).Most people reading this poem treat it as lightweight fare, a funny parody of a horror story.  Service probably intended it that way.But for my own amusement, and as a gesture towards Halloween, I've attempted to reinterpret the poem as genuine horror.  It wasn't easy!  The climactic stanza is hilarious, not scary.  I'll rely on you folks to tell me if I succeeded.Once again, folks who like their poems read as though they were songs, adhering tightly to their rhythmic structure, will be disappointed.  I don't read poems that way very often.Text of the full poem is here:http://www.robertwservice.com/modules/library/article.php?ar ticleid=30Happy Halloween, folks.  :-)

			This is my belove pet Toto. He is a very smart rabbit that do cool tricks.  What a fun way to open up your letter!! (Think twice before you taking a pet into your home and be a responsible owner because the little one needs you to feed them in order to survive.  Give them love and they will return to you.   I hope this video won't make people too itchy to go get a bunny without thinking twice.)

			Finally no more boring people on YouTube!You Tube theater makes the boring seem interesting!WARNING PLEASE READYou might ask yourself, what right does YOUTUBEtheater have to make fun of people? Well virtually everyone on youtube wants to be a celebrity. Don't think so? Ask yourself this, if someone wanted to interview  you about  your channel, would you be interviewed? And why? To get more people knowing about you? To get more subscriptions? I think the answer for most people would be yes to these questions.So just because someone wants to be a celebrity, do they deserve to be made fun of? Well with fame, comes many challenges. One of which is to deal with ridicule and those who might not like you. If you can't handle being made fun of, you shouldn't crave fame.Now having said this, how can you contribute to youtube without being ridiculed? Well the answer is quite obvious. Don't say stupid things (unless of course you're joking around).Remember there is a cure for stupidity. If you don't want to be made fun of, go read a book, read the newspaper, educate yourself. Otherwise, you just might end up on YOUTUBEtheater. Thank you,YOUTUBEtheater staff.

			Finally no more boring people on YouTube!You Tube theater makes the boring seem interesting!WARNING PLEASE READYou might ask yourself, what right does YOUTUBEtheater have to make fun of people? Well virtually everyone on youtube wants to be a celebrity. Don't think so? Ask yourself this, if someone wanted to interview  you about  your channel, would you be interviewed? And why? To get more people knowing about you? To get more subscriptions? I think the answer for most people would be yes to these questions.So just because someone wants to be a celebrity, do they deserve to be made fun of? Well with fame, comes many challenges. One of which is to deal with ridicule and those who might not like you. If you can't handle being made fun of, you shouldn't crave fame.Now having said this, how can you contribute to youtube without being ridiculed? Well the answer is quite obvious. Don't say stupid things (unless of course you're joking around).Remember there is a cure for stupidity. If you don't want to be made fun of, go read a book, read the newspaper, educate yourself. Otherwise, you just might end up on YOUTUBEtheater. Thank you,YOUTUBEtheater staff.

If you can't handle being made fun of, you shouldn't crave fame.Now having said this, how can you contribute to youtube without being ridiculed? Well the answer is quite obvious. Don't say stupid things (unless of course you're joking around).Remember there is a cure for stupidity. If you don't want to be made fun of, go read a book, read the newspaper, educate yourself. Otherwise, you just might end up on YOUTUBEtheater. Thank you,YOUTUBEtheater staff.

			The story of a loafer who sits around and watches TV all day and a girlfriend who threatens to leave him if he doesn't get off his ass and do something, is told via animated comic book. Inspired by the ""Take On Me"" video from the 80's (back when MTV still showed videos), this video combines live action and animation to tell it's tale. The video was written, directed, and animated by the band itself. We figured if OK GO and Beck could make their own videos..so could we.  We made ours in an apartment in Oakland on a ZERO dollar budget. Tell us what you think!""He Said, She Said.""  Directed by: Ryan Divine/Maldroid, 2006.www.maldroid.com

			My ex is a selfish pig and my landlord kept my security deposit.   I got angry, made a painting and talked about stuff.  It's all in here!This is the first in a long (hopefully) series of paintings accompanied with a video documenting the process of creating my artwork.  I came up with this idea that instead of just creating a painting, it would be great to have a video diary that shows me paint it, shows me talk about painting it, talk about my life - artistic, personal, etc.  BUY IT ON EBAY!  THE AUCTION ENDS ON SUNDAYhttp://cgi.ebay.com/DOLLYWANTSTOPLAY-Original-Painting- Surreal-Art-Macabre_W0QQitemZ130052619823QQihZ003QQcategoryZ 551QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItemI was always horrible at writing artist statements and believed that the process of creating art is more intuitive than cognitive.  Why not let myself ramble a bit on camera as I paint?  Wouldn't that make it a truly ideal statement?   I believe there is something to it.  This is the VERY FIRST painting/video and I plan to make this into a routine that I will continue for the rest of my artistic life.

			Click here for lyrics    6 year old Heather Martin sings a song that her mother wrote for her Brother Shaun who is serving in Iraq. The song is written from Heather's point of view.LyricsYou were almost sixteen when I came into the world.Mom and Dad had you first then 3 more boys I'm the baby girl.I sure have a lot to look up to in you, you're really smart and funny with a big heart too.After one year of college you knew what you had to do. It's just like you wanting to help with the war.So you joined the army when I was only 4.This time of year we talk of big plans but you're over seas in some distant land.You can't be here for Christmas, I don't understand. Chorus:When are you coming home, Shaun?When are you coming home?!We lit up the house like we always do but it doesn't seem bright 'cause we can't have you.In my prayers I ask God to keep you safe.And I'm trying to be really brave.Tell me that the fighting's through. Come home!I really miss you. It's hard to enjoy the holidays without you.But we're so proud of you and all the red white and blue.Remember that Jesus is your best friend,And someday our families will be together again.Wow! You know we'll have a great big party then.ChorusI want to show you how tall I've grown and introduce you to my new friends at school.Maybe we could go and get some ice cream together but I really don't care what we do.Chorus

			www.dynomighty.comLinkless, claspless, no strings attached fun!I started making these 5 years ago so i know all the fun tricks with them...Will I get stuck to everything metallic that I walk by?They won't come off under normal use since the magnets are more attracted to each other than any other metal object. When the pieces are open and there are two exposed ends, these ends are very strong and can easily attach to any nearby metal. However when the ends are closed the magnetic field is contained within the magnets themselves and very little residual force exists outside of the piece preventing it from simply coming off near any metallic objects.Concerns about computers hard drive:To affect your computer, a magnetic field has to exceed the coercively of the magnetic coating on the storage device. Hard drives have a coercively of a few thousand Oersteds, which means a field of the same number of Gauss is needed to demagnetize them. The magnetic field strength falls off with the cube of the distance, and even 3x the strength of ours can't wipe a hard drive if they're not touching it. Besides when worn the majority of the magnetic field will be constrained inside the circle.Health concerns... Iron in Blood:Iron atoms in a magnet are crammed together in a solid state about one atom apart from one another. In your blood only four iron atoms are allocated to each hemoglobin molecule, and they are separated by distances too great to form a magnet. This is easily tested by pricking your finger and placing a drop of your blood next to a magnet. - By Michael Shermer SCIENTIFIC AMERICANIf you have other FAQ's like credit cards, cell phones etc please see my FAQ page:http://www.dynomighty.com/faq.phpThanks,Terrence

			I produced this animation as a way of proposing to my girlfriend (now wife) Natasha. I assembled a team of 20 animators to assist me, including co-workers, as well as students from my 3D character animation class at the Art Institute of California-San Francisco. We created more than four minutes of animation in just three months. When it was completed, I surprised Natasha by bringing her to the Parkway Movie Theater in Oakland, where they played the animation on the big screen in front of over 100 of our friends and family. The entire event was filmed for the TLC television show ""A Perfect Proposal.""Director's Note: I pulled a George Lucas and retrofitted the opening shot of the animation to show a photo of the Natasha design from ""The Invitation"" rather than the earlier drawing of Natsha I had done, which I was never quite satisfied with. Also, after receiving many a tersely written emails, I finally decided to listen to the fans and have completely removed all scenes with Jar Jar Binks.

			Click here for lyrics    6 year old Heather Martin sings a song that her mother wrote for her Brother Shaun who is serving in Iraq. The song is written from Heather's point of view.LyricsYou were almost sixteen when I came into the world.Mom and Dad had you first then 3 more boys I'm the baby girl.I sure have a lot to look up to in you, you're really smart and funny with a big heart too.After one year of college you knew what you had to do. It's just like you wanting to help with the war.So you joined the army when I was only 4.This time of year we talk of big plans but you're over seas in some distant land.You can't be here for Christmas, I don't understand. Chorus:When are you coming home, Shaun?When are you coming home?!We lit up the house like we always do but it doesn't seem bright 'cause we can't have you.In my prayers I ask God to keep you safe.And I'm trying to be really brave.Tell me that the fighting's through. Come home!I really miss you. It's hard to enjoy the holidays without you.But we're so proud of you and all the red white and blue.Remember that Jesus is your best friend,And someday our families will be together again.Wow! You know we'll have a great big party then.ChorusI want to show you how tall I've grown and introduce you to my new friends at school.Maybe we could go and get some ice cream together but I really don't care what we do.Chorus

When I was sitting around trying to think of what kind of movie I could make about tube socks, I just figured ""THESE TUBE SOCKS, THEY NEED TO GO ON AN ADVENTURE.""And so, here is The Machinegun Opera.Advertisement chance: Visit my website!http://persona.mechafetus.comEDIT:Thanks to rockman Brandon @ insert credit, my video has been Kotakued amongst other things.

			James Provan presents...A stop motion music video about Christmas.WARNING - CONTAINS FLASHING IMAGESSo, I have finished Univeristy for Christmas, and I finally had the time to make a new video. No robot voice this time, instead I asked my friend Rachel for help, and she sang in the video! She is a very good singer.Song was written by me, all of the filming and stop motion, as well as editing was done by me. Rachel helped with some lyrics too =)Special thanks to my family for putting up with cameras everywhere, and for dancing like idiots =)

			Click here for lyricsEdit   This song is not meant to make a political statement of any kind. It's simply about a family that is missing a brother. The young man who joined the army did so of his own free will. He was 20 years old and his parents played no part in his decision to serve his country. They are proud to have such a brave son. I am only the best friend (for 34 years) of the mother, Cindy. It is my honor to post this video on YouTube. All of the wonderful messages that I have received are being forwarded to Heather and her mother.Heather loves to sing. Since she was small she has always tried to get to the microphone first at church so she could sing. She always loved karaoke and would beg for the mic. She still loves singing more than just about anything. Heather loves her brother and misses him. She has many memories of him. He comes home every chance he gets and will probably get to come home for a short time in February or March.Before I truned on the camera Heather was really acting silly and laughing. What many of you have said looks like crying at the first is just Heather rubbing her eyes like any 6 year old might do.end edit6 year old Heather Martin sings a song that her mother wrote for her Brother Shaun who is serving in Iraq. The song is written from Heather's point of view.LyricsYou were almost sixteen when I came into the world.Mom and Dad had you first then 3 more boys I'm the baby girl.I sure have a lot to look up to in you, you're really smart and funny with a big heart too.After one year of college you knew what you had to do. It's just like you wanting to help with the war.So you joined the army when I was only 4.This time of year we talk of big plans but you're over seas in some distant land.You can't be here for Christmas, I don't understand. Chorus:When are you coming home, Shaun?When are you coming home?!We lit up the house like we always do but it doesn't seem bright 'cause we can't have you.In my prayers I ask God to keep you safe.And I'm trying to be really brave.Tell me that the fighting's through. Come home!I really miss you. It's hard to enjoy the holidays without you.But we're so proud of you and all the red white and blue.Remember that Jesus is your best friend,And someday our families will be together again.Wow! You know we'll have a great big party then.ChorusI want to show you how tall I've grown and introduce you to my new friends at school.Maybe we could go and get some ice cream together but I really don't care what we do.Chorus

			A little stop motion animation I made for the company I work for. In a way It's a little present from me and from our company to our clients.It's all honest stop-motion, frame by frame drawn. Using a digital photocamera, real blackboard (that hangs in our office) and chalk. It was then imported to premiere - stretched and exported.People that you can see in some frames are my coworkers. Ow and in the beginning that's me. Music is written and played by my friend Ago Visak. The tune he wrote for me for my birthday.'More of his music http://myspace.com/klaveraagoI directed, drew the frames and put the thing together.(There's some stupid flaming going on in comments and video responces... sorry, try not to pay attention.)Enjoy
