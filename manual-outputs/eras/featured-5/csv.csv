The Original Cuppycake Video,55,"Thanks for the feature, YouTube!No lip-syncing here folks, This is the REAL DEAL!: The original 1994 video of ""The Cuppycake Song"" (words and music by Judianna Castle) being recorded by the original artist (our daughter, Amy at age 3) in our home studio. Although there were many takes of the song during the session, this was the one that made it onto our BALLOONS children's CD(www.cdbaby/buddycastle)and the one which has generated so much interest on the internet. Since uploading ""The Cuppycake Song"" to the web in 1996, it has truly taken on a life of it's own. On You Tube alone, there are currently at least 268 videos using this song! In the last ten years we have received thousands of unsolicited comments from people of all ages across the US and many countries around the world who have been touched by this simple song and the tiny voice that sings it. Now at last, you can see the face that goes with the voice. This should finally put to rest the false rumor that the song was sung by Strawberry Shortcake.

Card Magic - by Chris Brown the Sleight Artist,186,"I'm a magician/Sleight Artist with a purpose. My purpose is to keep you from aging. I love what magic does to people. It brings wonder back into their life of logic and understanding. As a kid your whole world is magic. But as you get older you figure out how things work so it doesn't seem so magical anymore. The older you get, the more distant you become from the feeling of when you were 6 and it was Christmas eve while you were waiting for Santa. I'm not looking for applaud or attention. All i want is to re-introduce magic for you. Because everybody loves this feeling, but we forget it as we grow older. What I do is sleight art. But its the reactions that makes this real magic. Don't clap for me. Don't. Just sit there. And be a kid again.Big thank you to Canibus for support and letting me use his song on this video.

			The reactable, is a multi-user electronic music instrument with a tabletop tangible user interface. Several simultaneous performers share complete control over the instrument by moving physical objects on a luminous table surface. By moving and relating these objects, representing components of a classic modular synthesizer, users can create complex and dynamic sonic topologies, with generators, filters and modulators, in a kind of tangible modular synthesizer or graspable flow-controlled programming language.This instrument is being developed by a team of digital luthiers (Sergi Jord√†, Martin Kaltenbrunner, G√ºnter Geiger and Marcos Alonso), at the Music Technology Group within the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain.More information:http://mtg.upf.edu/reactable",226469,marcosalonso,MPG-LYoW27E,,,3.5,,,1170551700000,"Sun, 04 Feb 2007 01:15:00 GMT",20070204011500,Science & Technology,,

Web 2.0 ... The Machine is Us/ing Us,271,"Web 2.0 in just under 5 minutes.This is the 2nd draft, and I plan on doing one more final draft.  Please leave comments on what could be changed or improved, or what needs to be excluded or included.  Subscribe if you want to be notified when the revision is released. UPDATE: I just added this video to Mojiti where you can actually write your comments into the video itself.  It is an exciting experiment in ""Video 2.0"".  Go check it out at http://mojiti.com/kan/2024/3313 and add your voice!A couple of people have noted that the statement, ""XML was created to do just that"" (separate form from content) is misleading because CSS enables the same effect with HTML.  I tried to integrate CSS into the video, but it ruined the flow.  Perhaps in the next draft.  My statement on XML is based on the following from xml.com: ""In order to appreciate XML, it is important to understand why it was created. XML was created so that richly structured documents could be used over the web. The only viable alternatives, HTML and SGML, are not practical for this purpose. HTML, as we've already discussed, comes bound with a set of semantics and does not provide arbitrary structure.""Thank you all for the comments.  With your help the next draft will be cleaned up and hopefully free of factual errors.A higher quality version is available for download here: http://www.mediafire.com/?6duzg3zioyd  Please note that this is the second draft and the final version will not be available until late February after I review all comments and revise the video.

			My intro is by: http://www.youtube.com/rhcomicsCheck him out. He'll do yours for a small fee.I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for digital freedom in the history of the Internet.2 years ago, two great computer nerds, in whose symbolic creation we sit before today, started the the YouTube Coperation. This momentous website came as a great beacon of hope to millions of Internet Nerds who had been seared in the flames of withering bad television. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long nights of boredom in front of their computer screens.But two year later, the Negro still is not on the front page. Two year later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of booty shaking videos and the chains of discrimination. I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from slow Internet connections. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for cheaper internet connection left you battered by the storms of greedy telecommunications companies and staggered by the winds of over charging telephone companies. And so even though we face the difficulties of 500 hundred sever error today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the YouTube dream.I have a YouTube dream that one day this Site will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""that we'll be able to post videos on YouTube.""I have a YouTube dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of computer programmers and sons of former computer cleaners will be able to sit down at the computer workstation of brotherhood.I have a YouTube dream that my fifty oddvideos will one day live in a YouTube where they will not be judged by the colour of their content maker but the content of their character.I have a dream today!I have a YouTube dream that one day, down on some PC, with their vicious racists having their fingures dripping with the ""N word"" -- one day right there on this machine little black boys and black girls will be able to do video collaborations with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.I have a YouTube dream today!I have a YouTube dream that one day every video shall be exalted, and every hateful comment shall be made low. This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to my machine.With this YouTube, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of haters a stone of hope. With this YouTube, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our YouTube into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this YouTube, we will be able to collaborate together, to comment together, to subscribe together, to stand up for digital freedom together.And if YouTube is to be a great YouTube, this must become true.And so let digital freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of South Africa.Let digital freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.Let digital freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.Let digital freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of China.From every keyboard, let freedom ring.And when this happens, when we allow digital freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every computer and every video, from every comment and everyone, we will be able to speed up that day when all of YouTube's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, Budhists and & Muslims, Scientologists and Tom Cruise, Jedis & Atheists, Cults and Jehova's witnesses, Fat people and skinny people, Chinnes and Japanese, Macs & PC, iPods and Zunes, Renetto and Greg SolomonDigital Freedom at last!

Heavy Metal Baghdad - Part 1 of 5,338,"From www.VBS.tv series. Parts 1-5 up now on VBS.tv.In 2003, just after the US toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein, Vice magazine published an article on the only heavy metal band in Iraq, Acrassicauda. The Baghdad-based band was formed in the last few years of Saddam's rule and aside from the typical problems every band has, they also had to deal with the stigma of playing dark western music in an Islamic state under Baath party rule, while coming out of a decade of war, sanctions, and poverty. We found their story inspiring. When we interviewed the band they were excited to be living in a newly freed Iraq, and their future seemed limitless. They even talked of recording an album. Things took a turn for the worse, however. After a few months respite, the situation in free Iraq deteriorated quickly and by the end of the year, after a few key insurgent attacks‚Äëthe bombing at the UN building, the massive strike at the grand Shi'a mosque in Najaf‚ÄëIraq started to unravel. We stayed in touch with the band through this time and in the fall of 2006, with the insurgency reaching a fevered pitch, VICE Co-Founder Suroosh Alvi and VBS Producer Eddy Moretti decided to visit them.For more go to www.vbs.tv",157098,VBSdotTV,TK9ZkW0HabQ,,,4.5,,,1173529171000,"Sat, 10 Mar 2007 12:19:31 GMT",20070310121931,News & Politics,,

Deputy Dressed As Leprechaun Tickets Speeding Drivers,89,"http://www.theliberalblogger.com/forumORANGE COUNTY, Fla. -- Speeding and aggressive drivers in Orange County needed more than the luck of the Irish to avoid a traffic citation on Thursday.An Orange County sheriff's deputy dressed as a leprechaun and equipped with a laser speed-detection gun targeted speeding and reckless motorists in the area of University Boulevard and state Road 417. The ""leprechaun"" also held a sign reading, ""Watch your speed or it will cost you your pot of gold.""Motorcycle units stopped violators and issued the traffic citations after being informed by the ""leprechaun"" via radio. Officials said they issued about a ticket per minute. A lot of the drivers complained about the method, calling it entrapment ""I think that's just ridiculous,"" a deputy said. ""The (leprechaun) didn't force anybody to speed."" Orange County sheriff's deputies said the laser gun enabled the on-duty ""leprechaun"" to clock a vehicle long before the driver would see him. In the past, Orange County sheriff's deputies have targeted speeding motorists while dressed as an elf, the Grinch and a man waiting for a bus. ""We do this sort of thing a lot on holidays,"" Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Solomons said.",370781,brendabeaver123,qj9KgUtdQVc,,,3.5,,,1174479023000,"Wed, 21 Mar 2007 12:10:23 GMT",20070321121023,News & Politics,,

TheAnimationEmpire - Fruits VS Bugs: Episode 1,311,"As we promised, here is an animation with the fruit characters in more of a ""story."" The Influence Bug and Trooper Bugs head out to Bobby Nelson's house to influence him to steal. It's up to the secret agent fruits, the Agents of the Spirit, to stop them!Thanks for the feature, YouTube! You're my hero.We used Photoshop, 3D Studio Max, Premiere, and Movie Maker. Check out http://www.Blender.org for free 3D animation software.Of course, this wouldn't be a TheAnimationEmpire video without a double-dose of nonsense and nostalgia. Look for references to Loony Tunes, Indiana Jones, Charlie's Angels, Spiderman, Star Wars Episode 2, Mortal Kombat, Super Mario Kart, The Simpsons, Yoshi, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jurassic Park, Kung Pow, The Matrix, Super Mario Brothers (Bros.) and, of course, a lot of secret agent themes. Our preview for Episode 2 even references Batman, Toy Story, and several more Star Wars themes.Our work has been compared to Shrek, Disney, and Pixar films (Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Cars, etc.). We can tell the difference because we don't have their 80 million dollar budget. =^)Constructive comments only please!Want another 3D animation? View our first animation with the fruit characters.

Charles Has A Licking Problem,55,"My dog Charles has a licking problem. I wrote a song about the licking, which accompanies this video.The licking is not a serious medical problem. Charles is under regular veterinary care, and was not harmed during the making of the video. He is just a weird dog.The song is called ""Charles Has A Licking Problem."" The lyrics are pretty easy, maybe you will want to sing along to my song.

"The Zimmers ""My Generation""",220,"www.myspace.com/thezimmersbandThe oldest and greatest rock band in the world - meet The Zimmers and their amazing cover of The Who's ""My Generation"".Lead singer Alf is 90 - it's quite something when he sings ""I hope I die before I get old"". And he's not the oldest - there are 99 and 100-year-olds in the band!The Zimmers will feature in a BBC TV documentary being aired in May 2007. Documentary-maker Tim Samuels has been all over Britain recruiting isolated and lonely old people - those who can't leave their flats or who are stuck in rubbish care homes.The finale of the show is this group of lonely old people coming together to stick it back to the society that's cast them aside - by forming a rock troupe and trying to storm into the pop charts.Some massive names from the pop world have thrown their weight behind The Zimmers... The song is produced by Mike Hedges (U2, Dido, Cure), the video shot by Geoff Wonfor (Band Aid, Beatles Anthology), and it was recorded in the legendary Beatles studio 2 at Abbey Road.Look out for the single being released from May 21 - with proceeds going to a good cause.And check out more photos and info at:www.myspace.com/thezimmersband",319240,oskpeturs,zqfFrCUrEbY,,,4.5,,,1176928406000,"Wed, 18 Apr 2007 20:33:26 GMT",20070418203326,Music,,

You can listen to her speak about what she needs here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJazNWHt_YcI wrote the essay as an expression of alienation, stubbornness, and a heaping load of irony.

Worms Making Music II,89,"A solo worm performing a thoughtful little number.  No worms were hurt.Following a gruelling audition process, one solo worm was hand selected to perform its own music, without proviso, upon a specially adapted and destabilised FM synthesis circuit disembowelled from a Yamaha PSS-470.  For one day, this worm was treated like royalty; whisked around London's swankiest mud spas and hermaphrodite clubs, before spending an evening at the very best hotel (whatever it's called, I dunno).  Ah, what a star...As for the machinations behind the pizzazz; a Yamaha FM synthesis board is sensitivised by overclocking it with a painfully high quartz crystal (17 Mhz), various components have either been removed or replaced, and the entire circuit hard wired to run on the lowest possible current/voltage (to avoid the worm getting hurt).  The worm was safely returned to its natural habitat.Incidentally, this video was submitted to (and rejected by) the Annual Slug & Worm Conference.  They did not like worm music one bit.If you liked this worm music however, more can be seen at the 6th Annual 'Noise!' Festival in Canada this year. A treat for the senses perhaps? More info:http://noise.industrial.org/Edit: Just a quick disclaimer... Again, I swear that the worm was not hurt! Please don't worry. The circuit was adapted to run on a very low current. The spasms are just involuntary reactions.",858,ashfordaisyak,Lb4jOCAr8ow,,,3.5,,,1177934992000,"Mon, 30 Apr 2007 12:09:52 GMT",20070430120952,Howto & DIY,,

Worms Making Music II,89,"A solo worm performing a thoughtful little number.  No worms were hurt.Following a gruelling audition process, one solo worm was hand selected to perform its own music, without proviso, upon a specially adapted and destabilised FM synthesis circuit disembowelled from a Yamaha PSS-470.  For one day, this worm was treated like royalty; whisked around London's swankiest mud spas and hermaphrodite clubs, before spending an evening at the very best hotel (whatever it's called, I dunno).  Ah, what a star...As for the machinations behind the pizzazz; a Yamaha FM synthesis board is sensitivised by overclocking it with a painfully high quartz crystal (17 Mhz), various components have either been removed or replaced, and the entire circuit hard wired to run on the lowest possible current/voltage (to avoid the worm getting hurt).  The worm was safely returned to its natural habitat.Incidentally, this video was submitted to (and rejected by) the Annual Slug & Worm Conference.  They did not like worm music one bit.If you liked this worm music however, more can be seen at the 6th Annual 'Noise!' Festival in Canada this year. A treat for the senses perhaps? More info:http://noise.industrial.org/Edit: Just a quick disclaimer... Again, I swear that the worm was not hurt! Please don't worry. The circuit was adapted to run on a very low current. The spasms are just involuntary reactions.EDIT 2 : Due to some concern for the worm's welfare, I state again that this circuit is ADAPTED to be as gentle on the worm as possible! It is an experimental way of creating aleatory music - with the worm's health being MOST IMPORTANT. The 'safe' worm current was basically calculated by scaling human resistance against an ampage that constitutes a painful shock, applying this to the worm's own resistance and developing a circuit that runs BELOW the resultant current.

Worms Making Music II,89,"A solo worm performing a thoughtful little number.  No worms were hurt.Following a gruelling audition process, one solo worm was hand selected to perform its own music, without proviso, upon a specially adapted and destabilised FM synthesis circuit disembowelled from a Yamaha PSS-470.  For one day, this worm was treated like royalty; whisked around London's swankiest mud spas and hermaphrodite clubs, before spending an evening at the very best hotel (whatever it's called, I dunno).  Ah, what a star...As for the machinations behind the pizzazz; a Yamaha FM synthesis board is sensitivised by overclocking it with a painfully high quartz crystal (17 Mhz), various components have either been removed or replaced, and the entire circuit hard wired to run on the lowest possible current/voltage (to avoid the worm getting hurt).  The worm was safely returned to its natural habitat.Incidentally, this video was submitted to (and rejected by) the Annual Slug & Worm Conference.  They did not like worm music one bit.If you liked this worm music however, more can be seen at the 6th Annual 'Noise!' Festival in Canada this year. A treat for the senses perhaps? More info:http://noise.industrial.org/Edit: Just a quick disclaimer... Again, I swear that the worm was not hurt! Please don't worry. The circuit was adapted to run on a very low current. The spasms are just involuntary reactions.EDIT 2 : Due to some concern for the worm's welfare, I state again that this circuit is ADAPTED to be as gentle on the worm as possible! It is an experimental way of creating aleatory music - with the worm's health being MOST IMPORTANT. The 'safe' worm current was basically calculated by scaling human resistance against an ampage that constitutes a painful shock, applying this to the worm's own resistance and developing a circuit that runs BELOW the resultant current. I tested the circuit on my tongue countless times to fine tune the voltage/current ratio, which is the closest thing on the human body that approximates the worm's resistance and nerve agglomeration.",577677,ashfordaisyak,Lb4jOCAr8ow,,,3.5,,,1178367142000,"Sat, 05 May 2007 12:12:22 GMT",20070505121222,Howto & DIY,,

Forgetfulness - Billy Collins Animated Poetry,111,"View poetry in an entirely new and innovative way. Billy Collins, former US Poet Laureate and one of America's best-selling poets, reads his poem ""Forgetfulness"" with animation by Julian Grey of Headgear.Noted for their intelligent humor, accessibility and observations on daily life, Collins' popular poems come alive further in a series of animated poems produced by JWT-NY.- - - - - -The Poem - The name of the author is the first to go followed obediently by the title, the plot, the heartbreaking conclusion, the entire novel which suddenly becomes one you have never read, never even heard of, as if, one by one, the memories you used to harbor decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain, to a little fishing village where there are no phones. Long ago you kissed the names of the nine Muses goodbye and watched the quadratic equation pack its bag, and even now as you memorize the order of the planets, something else is slipping away, a state flower perhaps, the address of an uncle, the capital of Paraguay. Whatever it is you are struggling to remember, it is not poised on the tip of your tongue, not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen. It has floated away down a dark mythological river whose name begins with an L as far as you can recall, well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those who have even forgotten how to swim and how to ride a bicycle. No wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war. No wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart.",160930,smjwt,wrEPJh14mcU,,,4.5,,,1178741123000,"Wed, 09 May 2007 20:05:23 GMT",20070509200523,Film & Animation,,

Giovanni Sollima - Sogno ad Occhi Aperti (Daydream) PART 1,380,"Directed by Lasse GjertsenCopyrights: Casa Musicale Sonzogno, Milan, 2007This is a music video for the italian cellist Giova
	
	
			Directed by Lasse GjertsenCopyrights: Casa Musicale Sonzogno, Milan, 2007This is a music video for the italian cellist Giovanni Sollima, on two of his compositions; ""Terra Aria"" and ""Concerto Rotondo"". Enjoy!www.sonzogno.itSo this is the project I've been working on for the last 5 months, and heres how part 1 of it is made: On the six arms parts, which by the way took most of the time to make, I filmed Sollima playing the different layers of cello after each other. I then edited the video frame by frame in Photoshop (remember, it's 25 frames per second of video), cutting his arms out from the other layers and pasting it on top, matching the movement of the cello. This was done ca 4000 times, by myself.The clouds were actually filmed in my backyard, sped up 1250 times. The birds we're filmed in my town, Larvik, Norway on clear blue sky, so that I could use blue screen keying to put them on top of the clouds. It's hard to notice, but the birds are moving in half speed slow motion. I also had to stabilize the motion of the birds, since I filmed it with handhelt camcorder. The sequence was cut together using After Effects and Premiere.The forest, river sequence was photographed in a forest in Arona, Italy. I took a picture ca. every five meters, and morphed the images together using WinMorph, matching the pace of the music.The zooming sequence is very hard to explain. Basically, the first 8 seconds after it starts zooming and when you see Mr Sollima's face is real photos. The rest inbetween are ""painted"" in Photoshop by me.The rest of this part is merely editing in Premiere and After Effects. Allright!

Giovanni Sollima - Sogno ad Occhi Aperti (Daydream) PART 1,380,"Directed by Lasse GjertsenCopyrights: Casa Musicale Sonzogno, Milan, 2007This is a music video for the italian cellist Giova
	
	
			Directed by Lasse GjertsenCopyrights: Casa Musicale Sonzogno, Milan, 2007This is a music video for the italian cellist Giovanni Sollima, on two of his compositions; ""Terra Aria"" and ""Concerto Rotondo"". Enjoy!www.sonzogno.itSo this is the project I've been working on for the last 5 months, and heres how part 1 of it is made: On the six arms parts, which by the way took most of the time to make, I filmed Sollima playing the different layers of cello after each other. I then edited the video frame by frame in Photoshop (remember, it's 25 frames per second of video), cutting his arms out from the other layers and pasting it on top, matching the movement of the cello. This was done ca 4000 times, by myself.The clouds were actually filmed in my backyard, sped up 1250 times. The birds we're filmed in my town, Larvik, Norway on clear blue sky, so that I could use blue screen keying to put them on top of the clouds. It's hard to notice, but the birds are moving in half speed slow motion. I also had to stabilize the motion of the birds, since I filmed it with handhelt camcorder. The sequence was cut together using After Effects and Premiere.The forest, river sequence was photographed in a forest in Arona, Italy. I took a picture ca. every five meters, and morphed the images together using WinMorph, matching the pace of the music.The zooming sequence is very hard to explain. Basically, the first 8 seconds after it starts zooming and when you see Mr Sollima's face is real photos. The rest inbetween are ""painted"" in Photoshop by me.The rest of this part is merely editing in Premiere and After Effects. Allright!

de Pong Game I - Art Rock festiv...,83,"De Pong Game is a recycling of the famous game PONG [Atari 1975-1977]. This new version has been built with Flash [Action Script] by Arjan Westerdiep for Recyclism‚Ñ¢ (Benjamin Gaulon). This project is exploring the concept of Augmented Reality by using and interacting with urban architectures [buildings] as background for the game. Thus the game is projected on a building and the limits of that building are becoming the limits of the game area. The ball projected on the building bounces along the limits of the walls. The software is also using the windows as an obstacles for the game. So the ball is limited to frame of the building. As you touch the ball with the slider, its speed increases and because the ball bounces on all the obstacles of the architecture it becomes more and more difficult to play.",39866,recyclism,dGAL2wWctII,,,3.5,,,1181045200000,"Tue, 05 Jun 2007 12:06:40 GMT",20070605120640,Gadgets & Games,YouTube,

Ta...,188,"High School Teacher & Slam Poet Taylor Mali on ""What Teachers Make""Check out Taylor's website here:http://www.taylormali.com/Or add him on MySpacehttp://www.myspace.com/taylormaliWhat is Slam Poetry?Slam poetry is a form of performance poetry that occurs within a competitive poetry event, called a ""slam"", at which poets perform their own poems (or, in rare cases, those of others) that are ""judged"" on a numeric scale by randomly picked members of the audience. Taylor Mali is considered to be the most successful poetry slam strategist of all time, having led six of his seven national poetry slam teams to the finals stage and winning the championship itself a record four times before anyone had even tied him at three, Mali was one of the original poets to appear on the HBO original series ""Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry."" He was also the ""golden-tongued, Armani clad villain"" of Paul Devlin's 1997 documentary film ""SlamNation,"" which chronicled the National Poetry Slam Championship of 1996, the year of Mali's first national team championship.~ SPEECH ~What Teachers Make, orObjection Overruled, orIf things don't work out, you can always go to law schoolBy Taylor Maliwww.taylormali.comHe says the problem with teachers is, ""What's a kid going to learnfrom someone who decided his best option in life was to become a teacher?""He reminds the other dinner guests that it's true what they say aboutteachers:That those who can, do; those who can't, teach.I decide to bite my tongue instead of hisand resist the urge to remind the other dinner gueststhat it's also true what they say about lawyers.Because we're eating, after all, and this is polite conversation.""I mean, you're a teacher, Taylor""""Be honest.

Space Intruder,278,"This animation was made for a yearly art festival in my hometown Maastricht. Showing all my old stuff wasn't an option. So I started building a set and tried to come up with a story with two characters and a lot of violence : ) Filming took six full days in a period of three weeks. I only had the chance to animate when I had a day off from work. But sculpting, storyboarding and setting up scenes where done every evening.A very talented Dutch musician (dob Audio) gave me the opportunity to use his music. I've worked very hard on it and hope you all like it.Here some details for other filmmakers and people who are interested:The set was build with a soft wooden floor, styrofoam, montage kit, paint and a little fake plant.The frame rate is mostly 12 fps, butsome parts where increased up to 24 fps. Exactly 2532 pictures where taken to complete the animation. The UFO part was shot real time with wires. But you probably saw that already (wires are clearly visible).All movements of the little blob character where done with replacements. Meaning that every framehas another ready sculpted replacement character. Almost 100 replacements where sculpted for all theblobs movements in the animation. It's a very quick way to animate : )The shots where a character comes out of the ground where filmed backwards, because it's easier to slice the character with fishing wire than to rebuild itThe clay I used is found in almost every toy store. It's modelling clay in a few different colors which stays soft. You can mix colors together to get the color you desire. Nails with both ends sharp where used to let the humanoid character stand in any position. The nails are hammered in the soft wooden floor and fit in holes under feet that reach a few centimeters up the legs for stability. The characters armature holds up to 30 individual small metal wires in each body part. It's impossible for a limb to break off even if you try. Metal strips are twisted around the metal wires to prevent bending on unwanted places (bones).The puppet is made using the buildup technique. Applying layers of cotton wool soaked in liquid rubber directly onto the armature. Acrylic paint is added to the liquid rubber to get the right color.I used a Canon MVX20i DV-cam and Stopmotion Pro Version 4. The blur effects where made with the character/object hanging on a wire and then moved the object/character while the frame was averaged. Magix Video Deluxx was used for editing. I used a picture from the moon of my previous animation (Misplaced) in the background. No clay was harmed during the production of this animation : )",224158,Sander79,im5JO8GaG7c,,,4.5,,,1182341296000,"Wed, 20 Jun 2007 12:08:16 GMT",20070620120816,Film & Animation,YouTube,

It's a very quick way to animate : )The shots where a character comes out of the ground were filmed backwards, because it's easier to slice the character with fishing wire than to rebuild itThe clay I used is found in almost every toy store. It's modelling clay in a few different colors which stays soft. You can mix colors together to get the color you desire. Nails with both ends sharp where used to let the humanoid character stand in any position. The nails are hammered in the soft wooden floor and fit in holes under feet that reach a few centimeters up the legs for stability. The characters armature holds up to 30 individual small metal wires in each body part. It's impossible for a limb to break off even if you try. Metal strips are twisted around the metal wires to prevent bending on unwanted places (bones).The puppet is made using the buildup technique. Applying layers of cotton wool soaked in liquid rubber directly onto the armature. Acrylic paint is added to the liquid rubber to get the right color.I used a Canon MVX20i DV-cam and Stopmotion Pro Version 4.

Space Intruder,278,"This animation was made for a yearly art festival in my hometown Maastricht (kunsttour.com). Showing all my old stuff wasn't an option. So I started building a set and tried to come up with a story with two characters and a lot of violence : ) Filming took six full days in a period of three weeks. I only had the chance to animate when I had a day off from work. But sculpting, storyboarding and setting up scenes where done every evening.A very talented Dutch musician (dob Audio) gave me the opportunity to use his music. I've worked very hard on it and hope you all like it.No clay was harmed during the production of this animation : )------------------------------------------------------------ -----------Here some details for other filmmakers and people who are interested:The set was build with a soft wooden floor, styrofoam, montage kit, paint and a little fake plant.The frame rate is mostly 12 fps, butsome parts where increased up to 24 fps. Exactly 2532 pictures where taken to complete the animation. The UFO part was shot real time with wires. But you probably saw that already (wires are clearly visible).All movements of the little blob character where done with replacements. Meaning that every framehas another ready sculpted replacement character. Almost 100 replacements where sculpted for all theblobs movements in the animation.

Space Intruder,278,"This animation was made for a yearly art festival in my hometown Maastricht (kunsttour.com). Showing all my old stuff wasn't an option. So I started building a set and tried to come up with a story with two characters and a lot of violence : ) Filming took six full days in a period of three weeks. I only had the chance to animate when I had a day off from work. But sculpting, storyboarding and setting up scenes where done every evening.A very talented Dutch musician (dob Audio) gave me the opportunity to use his music. I've worked very hard on it and hope you all like it.No clay was harmed during the production of this animation : )------------------------------------------------------------ -I'm unable to reply on messages till June 30th!! Due to long deserved vacation : )------------------------------------------------------------ -Here some details for other filmmakers and people who are interested:The set was build with a soft wooden floor, styrofoam, montage kit, paint and a little fake plant.The frame rate is mostly 12 fps, butsome parts where increased up to 24 fps. Exactly 2532 pictures where taken to complete the animation. The UFO part was shot real time with wires. But you probably saw that already (wires are clearly visible).All movements of the little blob character where done with replacements. Meaning that every framehas another ready sculpted replacement character. Almost 100 replacements where sculpted for all theblobs movements in the animation. It's a very quick way to animate : )The shots where a character comes out of the ground were filmed backwards, because it's easier to slice the character with fishing wire than to rebuild itThe clay I used is found in almost every toy store. It's modelling clay in a few different colors which stays soft. You can mix colors together to get the color you desire. Nails with both ends sharp where used to let the humanoid character stand in any position. The nails are hammered in the soft wooden floor and fit in holes under feet that reach a few centimeters up the legs for stability. The characters armature holds up to 30 individual small metal wires in each body part. It's impossible for a limb to break off even if you try. Metal strips are twisted around the metal wires to prevent bending on unwanted places (bones).The puppet is made using the buildup technique. Applying layers of cotton wool soaked in liquid rubber directly onto the armature. Acrylic paint is added to the liquid rubber to get the right color.I used a Canon MVX20i DV-cam and Stopmotion Pro Version 4. The blur effects where made with the character/object hanging on a wire and then moved the object/character while the frame was averaged. Magix Video Deluxx was used for editing. I used a picture from the moon of my previous animation (Misplaced) in the background.",605538,Sander79,im5JO8GaG7c,,,4.5,,,1182687032000,"Sun, 24 Jun 2007 12:10:32 GMT",20070624121032,Film & Animation,YouTube,

Its written for piano, but I don't have one here with me unfortunately.

Baby I'm incapable
I'll just break your heart
I'm letting go
I don't want to but I need to
To let you grow...

*CHORUS*

LYRICS:
I'm a right-clicka
I'm an iBook flippa
Macs and PCs - no fight gets bigga
Surf Safari or browse in I.E.
Better know what you rep(resent) - a Mac or PC!

USB 1-2.0, son, you don't know
watch my data flow
From MS-DOS command line prompts
Black backgrounds, no special sauce
Well I've only been around since '84
But my ease of use has done so much more
From a Plus to a Classic to a II GS
To a PowerPC, my OS is the best
So clickable, design is lickable
My aqua interface makes XP dispicable
Quick I pull the RAM stick out the slot
Then I swap it with generic
cause the port is hot 

If you see life through an LCD
Betta know your brand is it a Mac-or-PC?

Take a look at Vista
enjoy the view
I suggest Premium or the ultimate skew
cop a Dell with a graphics card - super fast
turn the arrow on and lick the glass
Tiger's fast as hell
But Leopard's got the boom
Time machine is mad mean
you're absurd - what's a zune?
Middle name: innovate
All features integrate
Now stay the hell out of my developers' conferences!
Nonsenses - I'm networking
You're not working
Stop staring at your built-in webcam
YouTube surfing
Ha! 1,000 views is pretty fresh 
ComputerGal36 even says I'm the best

He is the best with his videos
And cuts them all on his Final Cut Pro

Mac, PC, and Me, At Last 

When I run IT'S A iPOD!
Talk IT'S AN iPHONE!
Stuff I gotta have no matter what
It's an iLOAN!
I want an Intel, plus CS3,
but for now I'm streamin keynotes in bed
Listenin to Steve
Uh! Compatibility
Everybody fits with me
All the applications wanna get with my virility
At any time
Yo, it might go off
And you can ride it 
Til it's Micro-Soft 
Huh! Pay attention
I got a new invention
Steal your next idea
At the MacWorld Convention
But guess what
You'll always be behind
Cuz Mac is a state of mind

			Mr Roberts finds himself awoken inexplicably in a white room. A man sits before him at a desk and in between them stands a black button. If Mr Roberts pushes it, he will receive a briefcase filled with millions of dollars. Or he can take the key to the door and leave penniless. The catch? Pushing the button will result in the death of a human being. What would you do?

EDIT: Sone people have observed a similarity in the premise of this film and an revival episode of The Twilight Zone in 1986. Please note (1) We had never seen the episode and only learnt of it long after we'd finished the film (2) The Twilight Zone weren't the first to do it. It's an old premise called the 'Faustian Bargain', around since the 16th century (deal with the 'devil') (3) Our film is similar in premise, but different in plot, characters, dialogue, aesthetics, setting, moral meaning, religious undertone, twist etc. Please have the respect to not accuse us of plagiarism.


Our first professional short film. We made it for $200 and shot it on the stage of our old school. Fortunately, professional actor Robert Grubb agreed to act in it for free after reading the script. This film took nearly a year to put together, working on it in stages and creating the 'white' effect on a home PC. Please note that the younger actor, unlike Robert Grubb, has no formal acting training whatsoever.

We have just released the DVD of Black Button for international sale! The Black Button DVD contains:

- The Original Cut of the Film, in High-Quality MPEG2 Format

- The 11m 06s Director's Cut of the Film with Never Before Seen Footage

- ""Making of"" Featurette, Including Interview with Robert Grubb

- Audio Commentary with Lucas Crandles & Hayden Grubb

- Production Stills

LYRICS:
I'm a right-clicka
I'm an iBook flippa
Macs and PCs - no fight gets bigga
Surf Safari or browse in I.E.
Better know what you rep(resent) - a Mac or PC!

USB 1-2.0, son, you don't know
watch my data flow
From MS-DOS command line prompts
Black backgrounds, no special sauce
Well I've only been around since '84
But my ease of use has done so much more
From a Plus to a Classic to a II GS
To a PowerPC, my OS is the best
So clickable, design is lickable
My aqua interface makes XP dispicable
Quick I pull the RAM stick out the slot
Then I swap it with generic
cause the port is hot 

If you see life through an LCD
Betta know your brand is it a Mac-or-PC?

Take a look at Vista
enjoy the view
I suggest Premium or the ultimate skew
cop a Dell with a graphics card - super fast
turn the arrow on and lick the glass
Tiger's fast as hell
But Leopard's got the boom
Time machine is mad mean
you're absurd - what's a zune?
Middle name: innovate
All features integrate
Now stay the hell out of my developers' conferences!
Nonsenses - I'm networking
You're not working
Stop staring at your built-in webcam
YouTube surfing
Ha! 1,000 views is pretty fresh 
ComputerGal36 even says I'm the best

He is the best with his videos
And cuts them all on his Final Cut Pro

Mac, PC, and Me, At Last 

When I run IT'S A iPOD!
Talk IT'S AN iPHONE!
Stuff I gotta have no matter what
It's an iLOAN!
I want an Intel, plus CS3,
but for now I'm streamin keynotes in bed
Listenin to Steve
Uh! Compatibility
Everybody fits with me
All the applications wanna get with my virility
At any time
Yo, it might go off
And you can ride it 
Til it's Micro-Soft 
Huh! Pay attention
I got a new invention
Steal your next idea
At the MacWorld Convention
But guess what
You'll always be behind
Cuz Mac is a state of mind

			- Views aren't updating for some reason...

Mr Roberts finds himself awoken inexplicably in a white room. A man sits before him at a desk and in between them stands a black button. If Mr Roberts pushes it, he will receive a briefcase filled with millions of dollars. Or he can take the key to the door and leave penniless. The catch? Pushing the button will result in the death of a human being. What would you do?

EDIT 1: Sone people have observed a similarity in the premise of this film and an revival episode of The Twilight Zone in 1986. Please note (1) We had never seen the episode and only learnt of it long after we'd finished the film (2) The Twilight Zone weren't the first to do it. It's an old premise called the 'Faustian Bargain', around since the 16th century (deal with the 'devil') (3) Our film is similar in premise, but different in plot, characters, dialogue, aesthetics, setting, moral meaning, religious undertone, twist etc. Please have the respect to not accuse us of plagiarism.

EDIT 2: Firstly, thanks YouTube for the feature! Secondly, thanks to all of you for watching and commenting! I'll just take the time to say that we have no particular religious affiliation; this is a fictional work and its ideas are designed to encourage thought and debate, not comment on any particular theology. If it encourages healthy and friendly discussion, we've done our job! 

EDIT 3: Lots of good discussion about what we would all do in the same situation. I invite anyone interested to post a video response to this question - 'What Would You Do?'

Also, unless the Matrix has a copyright on the colour white, this film has nothing to do with the Matrix. The Twilight Zone, Star Trek, The Outer Limits, an obscure Roman Portugese writer etc, we are all using the SAME PREMISE. It's the Faustian Bargain and it's been around for centuries. Each version, including ours, aims to bring something new to an old idea.

Our first professional short film. We made it for $200 and shot it on the stage of our old school in Melbourne, Australia. Fortunately, professional actor Robert Grubb agreed to act in it for free after reading the script. This film took nearly a year to put together, working on it in stages and creating the 'white' effect on a home PC. Please note that the younger actor, unlike Robert Grubb, has no formal acting training whatsoever.

Better know what you rep(resent) - a Mac or PC!

USB 1-2.0, son, you don't know
watch my data flow
From MS-DOS command line prompts
Black backgrounds, no special sauce
Well I've only been around since '84
But my ease of use has done so much more
From a Plus to a Classic to a II GS
To a PowerPC, my OS is the best
So clickable, design is lickable
My aqua interface makes XP dispicable
Quick I pull the RAM stick out the slot
Then I swap it with generic
cause the port is hot 

If you see life through an LCD
Betta know your brand is it a Mac-or-PC?

Take a look at Vista
enjoy the view
I suggest Premium or the ultimate skew
cop a Dell with a graphics card - super fast
turn the arrow on and lick the glass
Tiger's fast as hell
But Leopard's got the boom
Time machine is mad mean
you're absurd - what's a zune?
Middle name: innovate
All features integrate
Now stay the hell out of my developers' conferences!
Nonsenses - I'm networking
You're not working
Stop staring at your built-in webcam
YouTube surfing
Ha! 1,000 views is pretty fresh 
ComputerGal36 even says I'm the best

He is the best with his videos
And cuts them all on his Final Cut Pro

Mac, PC, and Me, At Last 

When I run IT'S A iPOD!
Talk IT'S AN iPHONE!
Stuff I gotta have no matter what
It's an iLOAN!
I want an Intel, plus CS3,
but for now I'm streamin keynotes in bed
Listenin to Steve
Uh! Compatibility
Everybody fits with me
All the applications wanna get with my virility
At any time
Yo, it might go off
And you can ride it 
Til it's Micro-Soft 
Huh! Pay attention
I got a new invention
Steal your next idea
At the MacWorld Convention
But guess what
You'll always be behind
Cuz Mac is a state of mind

			Mr Roberts finds himself awoken inexplicably in a white room. A man sits before him at a desk and in between them stands a black button. If Mr Roberts pushes it, he will receive a briefcase filled with millions of dollars. Or he can take the key to the door and leave penniless. The catch? Pushing the button will result in the death of a human being. What would you do?

EDIT 1: Some people have observed a similarity in the premise of this film and an revival episode of The Twilight Zone in 1986. Please note (1) We had never seen the episode and only learnt of it long after we'd finished the film (2) The Twilight Zone weren't the first to do it. It's an old premise called the 'Faustian Bargain', around since the 16th century (deal with the 'devil') (3) Our film is similar in premise, but different in plot, characters, dialogue, aesthetics, setting, moral meaning, religious undertone, twist etc. Please have the respect to not accuse us of plagiarism.

EDIT 2: Firstly, thanks YouTube for the feature! Secondly, thanks to all of you for watching and commenting! I'll just take the time to say that we have no particular religious affiliation; this is a fictional work and its ideas are designed to encourage thought and debate, not comment on any particular theology. If it encourages healthy and friendly discussion, we've done our job! 

EDIT 3: Lots of good discussion about what we would all do in the same situation. I invite anyone interested to post a video response to this question - 'What Would You Do?'

Also, unless the Matrix has a copyright on the colour white, this film has nothing to do with the Matrix. The Twilight Zone, Star Trek, The Outer Limits, an obscure Roman Portugese writer etc, we are all using the SAME PREMISE. It's the Faustian Bargain and it's been around for centuries. Each version, including ours, aims to bring something new to an old idea.

Our first professional short film. We made it for $200 and shot it on the stage of our old school in Melbourne, Australia. Fortunately, professional actor Robert Grubb agreed to act in it for free after reading the script. This film took nearly a year to put together, working on it in stages and creating the 'white' effect on a home PC. Please note that the younger actor, unlike Robert Grubb, has no formal acting training whatsoever.

The Making of ""Black Button"" is now on YouTube.

Falcor panicked whenever I sang ""FAALCOOOORRR!"" - Not because it's his name... but because it was really, really bad.

Technically, he's my niece's dog.  But... I'm not a technician.

Falcor was a dog...

I mean... he was... a dragon-dog.

Ok, maybe he was... just my dog.

But he was still FALCOR!!

Urinating on the carpet,
Nappinating on the pee-pad,
Chewinating the sofa,

BTW, he's a shih-tzu.

Brotherhood 2.0 is a year-long project in which brothers Hank and John Green have abandoned textual communication in favor of daily videoblogs. (Hank does a song every Wednesday!) Join the nerdfighters at www.brotherhood2.com. 

Song lyrics:

I'm gettin kinda tired of this
prepublication media blitz
they've got all of muggle kind under their spell

don't they know the whole world's already gone
and reserved a copy from amazon
how many more books could you sell?
Just give me that book or go to hell.

{chorus}
Cause I need ... Harry Potter
Like a grindylow needs water
as Saturday approaches my need grows

Accio Deathly Hallows
Incendio Book Sales Embargoes
It'll feel like phoenix tears on a broken nose
Accio deathly hallows 
Accio deathly hallows

I'm getting kinda petrified
What would Ron do if Hermione died
Or if Voldemort killed Hedwig just for yucks

I have no confidence
in theories about the half blood prince
And what if Harry's brain is a horcrux
Holy crap that would frikkin suck.

{chorus}

{bridge}
Whatever's up the sleve of JK Rowling
I bet it has to do with snape unbreakably vowing
to protect that pureblood pus face Malfoy




But in the end I don't think it's gonna matter
if Snape's good, or if he's bad
because the weight of the world rests on our boy.
Yeah the weight of the world rests on our boy

{chorus}

But mostly I'm just feelin' sad
I know this could end real bad but
I wish it didn't have to end at all
Yeah I wish it didn't have to end at all

Cause I couldn't care more about Harry Potter
If Hogwarts was my Alma Mater....

It's fantastically easy to play...Chord Progression:

Border Collie Attacks Pumpkin,192,"Dixie destroys a Giant Pumpkin.  A couple of weeks ago my brother MattB needed me to baby sit his dogs (Dixie and Koko) for the day.  Dixie is a border collie who always seems to find a task.  She must have something to do all the time...
 They spent the day in  our shop where we build wind turbines.  Our good freind Zubbly grows Giant Pumpkins and he sent some seeds last year.  Heather (my Mom) planted those last spring and gave my daughter Maya the largest pumpkin of the lot.  It sat around here in the shop for a couple months and then.. when we had Dixie and she seemed kinda bored we decided to let her take out her anxieties on the giant pumpkin.  Over the course of about 10 min she totally destroyed an 80 pound pumpkin.  In this video we've compressed about 7 of those min. into about 3.  Adam Brandon filmed this, check out adambrandon.com.  He was up working with us on a DVD were making that shows how we build wind turbines.  Too much fun!!!!

			Visit http://www.shinygrape.com to find out more about Nagymama and see more fun stuff! Updates: I am going to add a bunch of clarifications because the comments keep dropping down. 
1.) I am very pleased to see so many people that can speak Hungarian and I understand the confusion over ""What grandma is saying."" No offense intended, believe me! Originally, this was shown to an English-speaking audience, so the scene with the bedroom was supposed to sound like a very upset rant from Nagymama! I wanted to use grandma's real voice in the scene with the bed, but I could not really instruct my grandmother to ""act."" Instead, I took some audio I videotaped her (some of the scenes are posted on my website so you can see the context of the conversation.) So, if anyone is curious, here is the translation for the bed scene: 
""Dollar! Smelly stingy pig, he got $50,000 that he shares with his Mistress, but you don't get a thing."" I originally chose to use this sound clip because my deadbeat dad is probably the #1 thing my grandmother talked to herself about, even in her sleep (which is really sweet if you think about it - she's just looking out for me!) 

2.) As for the end credit scene was translated as a joke since the other thing Nagymama usually rants about is gypsies and robbers watching her through the window, and her plans to chase them away with her broom. I used that particular clip because she points at the camera, but the subtitles were a joke based on things she has said in the past. The actual subtitles are (drumroll):
""I'm going to play the lotto, and if I win, I will put it in an envelope for you."" Also sweet and funny, but my animation class seemed to like the ""joke"" subtitles better. 

3.) I speak Hungarian (but if I were to try to write it, I would probably butcher the lovely language,) but not Romanian. I kid you not, my family never taught me Romanian ""so they could talk about me without me listening!"" 

4.) I have no idea why the view-count of the film is still ""broken""; I think it is a technical problem on YouTube's end. I noticed it was a real problem when the live-action clips of Nagymama were getting higher view-counts than the featured video!

5.) I am well aware that Transylvania is Romania, but the household language of my family is Hungarian. I suppose you get a lot of language cross-over when you have countries that border one another/had border changes. 

6.) Thank you for your letters! I will give them all to Nagymama this weekend, although I am going to have a heck of a time explaining to her that she's a famous granny. The last time she was near a computer, she used the monitor to hold up her flower-pot! 

Okay, that's it for now. Thank you for reading and watching! Onto the....
Nagymama Challenge!! I want to hear YOUR grandma and grandpa stories! You need not have a Hungarian granny -- you just need a grandparent that is awesome like Nagymama! Did she make you wear itchy sweaters when you were a kid? Did he force you to sit at the table until you finished your peas? In what way did you grandparents leave a lasting impression on you? And if your grandparents are alive, go talk to them and get it on tape. Ask them about their time in the war, ask them about their first kiss -- please ask them before it's too late! And of course, report back to us at the new group http://www.youtube.com/group/s toriesfromgrandpa
Selected films will be featured on shinygrape.com under American Goulash!

Brotherhood 2.0 is a year-long project in which brothers Hank and John Green have abandoned textual communication in favor of daily videoblogs. (Hank does a song every Wednesday!) Join the nerdfighters at www.brotherhood2.com. 

Song lyrics:

I'm gettin kinda tired of this
prepublication media blitz
they've got all of muggle kind under their spell

don't they know the whole world's already gone
and reserved a copy from amazon
how many more books could you sell?
Just give me that book or go to hell.

{chorus}
Cause I need ... Harry Potter
Like a grindylow needs water
as Saturday approaches my need grows

Accio Deathly Hallows
Incendio Book Sales Embargoes
It'll feel like phoenix tears on a broken nose
Accio deathly hallows 
Accio deathly hallows

I'm getting kinda petrified
What would Ron do if Hermione died
Or if Voldemort killed Hedwig just for yucks

I have no confidence
in theories about the half blood prince
And what if Harry's brain is a horcrux
Holy crap that would frikkin suck.

{chorus}

{bridge}
Whatever's up the sleve of JK Rowling
I bet it has to do with snape unbreakably vowing
to protect that pureblood pus face Malfoy




But in the end I don't think it's gonna matter
if Snape's good, or if he's bad
because the weight of the world rests on our boy.
Yeah the weight of the world rests on our boy

{chorus}

But mostly I'm just feelin' sad
I know this could end real bad but
I wish it didn't have to end at all
Yeah I wish it didn't have to end at all

Cause I couldn't care more about Harry Potter
If Hogwarts was my Alma Mater....

It's fantastically easy to play...Chord Progression:

Border Collie Attacks Pumpkin,192,"Dixie destroys a Giant Pumpkin.  A couple of weeks ago my brother MattB needed me to baby sit his dogs (Dixie and Koko) for the day.  Dixie is a border collie who always seems to find a task.  She must have something to do all the time...
 They spent the day in  our shop where we build wind turbines.  Our good freind Zubbly grows Giant Pumpkins and he sent some seeds last year.  Heather (my Mom) planted those last spring and gave my daughter Maya the largest pumpkin of the lot.  It sat around here in the shop for a couple months and then.. when we had Dixie and she seemed kinda bored we decided to let her take out her anxieties on the giant pumpkin.  Over the course of about 10 min she totally destroyed an 80 pound pumpkin.  In this video we've compressed about 7 of those min. into about 3.  Adam Brandon filmed this, check out adambrandon.com.  He was up working with us on a DVD were making that shows how we build wind turbines.  Too much fun!!!!

1.) I am very pleased to see so many people that can speak Hungarian and I understand the confusion over ""What grandma is saying."" No offense intended, believe me! Originally, this was shown to an English-speaking audience, so the scene with the bedroom was supposed to sound like a very upset rant from Nagymama! I wanted to use grandma's real voice in the scene with the bed, but I could not really instruct my grandmother to ""act."" Instead, I took some audio I videotaped her (some of the scenes are posted on my website so you can see the context of the conversation.) So, if anyone is curious, here is the translation for the bed scene: 
""Dollar! Smelly stingy pig, he got $50,000 that he shares with his Mistress, but you don't get a thing."" I originally chose to use this sound clip because my deadbeat dad is probably the #1 thing my grandmother talked to herself about, even in her sleep (which is really sweet if you think about it - she's just looking out for me!) 

2.) As for the end credit scene was translated as a joke since the other thing Nagymama usually rants about is gypsies and robbers watching her through the window, and her plans to chase them away with her broom. I used that particular clip because she points at the camera, but the subtitles were a joke based on things she has said in the past. The actual subtitles are (drumroll):
""I'm going to play the lotto, and if I win, I will put it in an envelope for you."" Also sweet and funny, but my animation class seemed to like the ""joke"" subtitles better. 

3.) I speak Hungarian (but if I were to try to write it, I would probably butcher the lovely language,) but not Romanian. I kid you not, my family never taught me Romanian ""so they could talk about me without me listening!"" 

4.) I have no idea why the view-count of the film is still ""broken""; I think it is a technical problem on YouTube's end. I noticed it was a real problem when the live-action clips of Nagymama were getting higher view-counts than the featured video!

5.) I am well aware that Transylvania is Romania, but the household language of my family is Hungarian. I suppose you get a lot of language cross-over when you have countries that border one another/had border changes. 

6.) Thank you for your letters! I will give them all to Nagymama this weekend, although I am going to have a heck of a time explaining to her that she's a famous granny. The last time she was near a computer, she used the monitor to hold up her flower-pot! 

Okay, that's it for now. Thank you for reading and watching! Onto the....
Nagymama Challenge!! I want to hear YOUR grandma and grandpa stories! You need not have a Hungarian granny -- you just need a grandparent that is awesome like Nagymama! Did she make you wear itchy sweaters when you were a kid? Did he force you to sit at the table until you finished your peas? In what way did you grandparents leave a lasting impression on you? And if your grandparents are alive, go talk to them and get it on tape. Ask them about their time in the war, ask them about their first kiss -- please ask them before it's too late!

Singing Tesla Coil at Duckon 2007,162,"This is a solid-state Tesla coil. The primary runs at its resonant frequency in the 41 KHz range, and is modulated from the control unit in order to generate the tones you hear.

So just to explain a little further, yes, it is the actual high voltage sparks that are making the noise. Every cycle of the music is a burst of sparks at 41 KHz, triggered by digital circuitry at the end of a ""long"" piece of fiber optics.

What's not immediately obvious in this video is how loud this is. Many people were covering their ears, dogs were barking. In the sections where the crowd is cheering and the coils is starting and stopping, you can hear the the crowd is drowned out by the coil when it's firing.

This Tesla coil was built and is owned by Steve Ward. Steve is a EE student at U of I Urbana-Champaign. He and Jeff have been going to Teslathons, which is where they met.

July 18: Accio Deathly Hallows (...,233,"DOWNLOAD THE SONG: http://www.brotherhood2.com

Brotherhood 2.0 is a year-long project in which brothers Hank and John Green have abandoned textual communication in favor of daily videoblogs. (Hank does a song every Wednesday!) Join the nerdfighters at www.brotherhood2.com. 

Song lyrics:

I'm gettin kinda tired of this
prepublication media blitz
they've got all of muggle kind under their spell

don't they know the whole world's already gone
and reserved a copy from amazon
how many more books could you sell?
Just give me that book or go to hell.

{chorus}
Cause I need ... Harry Potter
Like a grindylow needs water
as Saturday approaches my need grows

Accio Deathly Hallows
Incendio Book Sales Embargoes
It'll feel like phoenix tears on a broken nose
Accio deathly hallows 
Accio deathly hallows

I'm getting kinda petrified
What would Ron do if Hermione died
Or if Voldemort killed Hedwig just for yucks

I have no confidence
in theories about the half blood prince
And what if Harry's brain is a horcrux
Holy crap that would frikkin suck.

{chorus}

{bridge}
Whatever's up the sleve of JK Rowling
I bet it has to do with snape unbreakably vowing
to protect that pureblood pus face Malfoy




But in the end I don't think it's gonna matter
if Snape's good, or if he's bad
because the weight of the world rests on our boy.
Yeah the weight of the world rests on our boy

{chorus}

But mostly I'm just feelin' sad
I know this could end real bad but
I wish it didn't have to end at all
Yeah I wish it didn't have to end at all

Cause I couldn't care more about Harry Potter
If Hogwarts was my Alma Mater....

It's fantastically easy to play...Chord Progression:

Border Collie Attacks Pumpkin,192,"Dixie destroys a Giant Pumpkin.  A couple of weeks ago my brother MattB needed me to baby sit his dogs (Dixie and Koko) for the day.  Dixie is a border collie who always seems to find a task.  She must have something to do all the time...
 They spent the day in  our shop where we build wind turbines.  Our good freind Zubbly grows Giant Pumpkins and he sent some seeds last year.  Heather (my Mom) planted those last spring and gave my daughter Maya the largest pumpkin of the lot.  It sat around here in the shop for a couple months and then.. when we had Dixie and she seemed kinda bored we decided to let her take out her anxieties on the giant pumpkin.  Over the course of about 10 min she totally destroyed an 80 pound pumpkin.  In this video we've compressed about 7 of those min. into about 3.  Adam Brandon filmed this, check out adambrandon.com.  He was up working with us on a DVD were making that shows how we build wind turbines.  Too much fun!!!!
Anyhow... sometimes otherpower.com spends its time building windmills.. sometimes it spends its time playing with the dogs.  Watching dogs is usually better than watching television.  One months worth of dog food costs about as much as your average cable connection.",423578,otherpower,6kmu6bLEetc,,,4.5,,,1186021494000,"Thu, 02 Aug 2007 02:24:54 GMT",20070802022454,Pets & Animals,,

Singing Tesla Coil at Duckon 2007,162,"This is a solid-state Tesla coil. The primary runs at its resonant frequency in the 41 KHz range, and is modulated from the control unit in order to generate the tones you hear.

So just to explain a little further, yes, it is the actual high voltage sparks that are making the noise. Every cycle of the music is a burst of sparks at 41 KHz, triggered by digital circuitry at the end of a ""long"" piece of fiber optics.

What's not immediately obvious in this video is how loud this is. Many people were covering their ears, dogs were barking. In the sections where the crowd is cheering and the coils is starting and stopping, you can hear the the crowd is drowned out by the coil when it's firing.

This Tesla coil was built and is owned by Steve Ward. Steve is a EE student at U of I Urbana-Champaign. He and Jeff have been going to Teslathons, which is where they met.

It's been suggested that a good name for this coil would be the ""Zeusaphone"". ""Thoremin"" has also been mentioned, though personally I think we need Theramin type inputs for that.

To answer a few questions I've received, YES, someone did yell ""Play Freebird!"" after the first round of music.",378300,demjp8RqDA,3ff_AXVlo9U,,,4.5,,,1186081071000,"Thu, 02 Aug 2007 18:57:51 GMT",20070802185751,Gadgets & Games,,

"'Harold Buttleman, Daredevil Stu...",5719,"A feature film from the makers of 'God, Inc'. Harold Buttleman, small town tuxedo salesman, thinks he's the next Evel Knievel. He's not.

Now you can help support my projects - I get a dollar for everyone who joins Spout (it's free!)- http://www.spout.com/francisst okes
You can buy DVDs here: http://www.customflix.com/2336 33

Synopsis: Harold Buttleman (John Hawkes, 'Deadwood') is a small town tuxedo salesman who thinks he's the next Evel Knievel. He is on the brink of TV stardom (a 3 a.m. spot on late night cable access), but the life of a daredevil stuntman is harder than it looks. Harold's parents want him to move out of their basement and his girlfriend wants him to settle into a career selling bathtub parts.

For Harold, it all depends on his big break - he gathers the entire town for his gala premiere celebration, but there's a surprise in store. An offbeat comedy about following your dreams, and the finer points of being shot out of a cannon. Also stars Anita Barone, Stephen Falk ('God, Inc'), Stephanie Jane Markham ('God, Inc'), Karen Black ('Easy Rider') and Dan Castellaneta ('The Simpsons').

Lyrics:

oowaooo, ooo, ooo, ooooooooo
ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, o-oo
yo flo 
sup mimi
wanna introduce you to this dude, think I really love this dude
yeah
girl hes so fine
stands about 5'10"", perfect for a boyfriend
damn
he rides a bmx (mm), never pressures me for sex (what)
yin-yang on his pecs (ooo), plus he's makin checks
so hes got a loft in soho (soho?), reminds me of han solo
oly moves in slo-mo
wait a minute hold on dog
do he got a cat?
yep
is that cat's name Bud?
yep
do he got a birthmark on the left side of his...
girl
went to UVM
yep
works for Meals on Wheels
yep
girl I cant believe this sh*#, damn, mmm
tell me what's wrong dog, what the heck you damnin bout, I'm your homegirl so just say what's on your mind
girl I didn't know that you were talkin bout him
so are you tellin me you know him?
do I know him? like a fat man knows his food.

we're messin with the same dude, same dude
how could the love of my life and my potential husband be the same dude, same dude
girl I can't believe that we've been messin with the same dude, same dude
thought he was someone I could trust, but he's been doubling up with us
mimi
flo
girl we've been messin with the same dude

see I met him at this party up in brooklyn (hey hey)
well I met him at this picnic in wisconsin (ho ho)
he came right up to me givin me conversation
I said do you got a girl, he said no with no hesitation
well it must be a player thing, cuz he said the same to me, had his body all in my face 
while I'm laughin and gettin him beer
he whispered in my ear, said ""can I take you home""
me too, man he was on the farm singin that same song
is that true?
and I thought it was true confession when he said
I love you, girl I thought his body was callin when he said
I want you
look I even got some pictures on my phone
look at there, there he is with some girl shorts on

we're messin with the same dude, same dude
he was the apple of my eye, and my potential husband same dude, same dude
girl I can't believe that we've been messin with the same same dude, oh yeah
thought he was someone I could trust
but he's been doubling up with both of us
mimi (hey)
flo (hey)
girl we've been messin with the same dude

he said he got me on his desktop.
are you talkin bout the laptop?
mm mm, the one on his desk.
girl he told me that was f#¬©*ed up.
it obvious that he's been playin us, playin us
cuz constantly he's been lyin to us, lyin to us
he thinks that he can get away with it, away with it
lets show this punk that we won't take this sh*#, 
take this sh*#
call him up at his home, he won't know I'm on the phone
I'ma f#¬©*in kill this man
damn girl, that's a plan!
girl just ask him to meet up with you and I'm gonna show up too
and he won't know what to do
we'll be beating him, singing

same dude, same dude
he was the apple of my eye (what)
but he's just a total douchebag
same dude, same dude
I just still can't believe (hey) we've been messin with the same dude, ooooo
he's gonna be lookin so stupid when he see us together
mimi
flo
girl we've been messin with the same dude

see he was takin trains (hey), every night and day (hey)
I would go meet him (hey) at the subway
I really cant believe
I can't believe it... no
hey

""Glenn Gregory is best known as the front man for Heaven 17, but for the last few years he's been one half of Honeyroot and they've just made one of the best albums of the year so far"" says Daniel Griffiths, editor of Future Music. Today's most successful artists have  one thing in common - the ability to re-invent themselves and challenge their audiences and Glenn Gregory has done just that. Teaming up with partner Keith Lowndes their latest album 'The Sun Will Come' (6th Aug in UK) is ""a beautifully crafted record, part Morcheeba, part Zero 7, part Air, part Royksopp...but this is in a different league...A modern day soul record in the cutest disguise you'll ever come across"" M8. 'Where I Belong', is the ""future smash hit single"" (Tom Robinson) from the album with floating vocals (""blissful dreamscapes"" Sunday Express) from Kim Richey wrapping themselves around this optimistic piece of dance/pop perfection.  ""Absolutely gorgeous, make sure you get the album"" Janice Long.

I was practicing a song when my foster kitty, Blip Blip, made himself at home. So, out came the camera, song ready or not (not, I know there are some  picking and timing glitches but hey, opportunity came a knockin'. I wasn't even planning on releasing this song. I was just practicing when this little guy made me rush for the camera). 

This is not so much a music video but an ode to Blip Blip and a perfect way to put together all his film clips. I raised him from just 3 weeks old to about 4 months old. He's a dear and it was very hard to return him to the Humane Society(I'm part of their foster program). But, I knew he'd make a great companion for some lucky person and I already have plenty of cats. He's a little thinker and I miss him.


""Riverside""
words & music by Mary Win
copyright 2007

I'll always be here in my heart  

I lie still
My heart chills
Soft breeze flies
Loving riverside

I'll always keep you in my heart

Smokey wine
We've lost time
Mountains near
I'll always hold you dear

I'll always keep you in my heart

Your blue eyes 
Smiling into mine
Your warm touch 
Can never be too much

I'll always keep you in my heart

Sun will shine 
As our times pass by
Hands held laced
I'll always see your face

I'll always keep you in my heart


______________________________ ____

I started posting videos so I can share my music with people all over the world.

As for me, I always seem to be watching funny kittens & puppies or any other super cute pet videos. Yes, I admit to being a cat person. Dogs are cool but cats curl up on your keyboard when you're working and give you an excuse to take lunch. I enjoy Family Guy, love Robot Chicken, Inuyasha, Naruto (most anime), American Idol and Planet Earth (in HD). The Office is a great comedy but very embarrassing (secret crush on Dwight).
 
And now a little rant... I've noticed something about females in my generation. I live by a skate-park and everytime I pass-by ""busty teen babes"" just sit idly on their hands, acting sexy, as guys perform skateboard tricks and stunts (not idle). The girls' dress code is the ""all empowering"" ""look at my breasts"" camisoles or the popular ""I just got boobs"" tank top, paired with hot ultra low rider ""look at my pubic bone"" jeans, thong or g-string. Being half nude sex objects for boys to show off to one another is a dead-end road.

Anyway, hope I didn't bore you but I'm a yapper.

‚òÖUpdate‚òÖ Blip Blip was a ""foster"" kitten with my local Humane Society. After returning him, he was adopted the very next day =^-^=

‚òÖ Also ‚òÖ there seems to be some confusion about why Blip Blip was returned to the Humane Society. I am a foster parent who takes in kittens who are too young to adopt out and provides a safe & loving environment until they reach an adoptable age. Blip Blip was never in any danger of being destroyed. Once a foster kitten is returned, the Humane Society makes potential adopters fill out a questionnaire to ensure that they are sincere and capable. Also, the adopter must pay an adoption fee of $100+ to the Humane Society. Fostering is charitable and I receive no pay. If I chose to keep my fosters I would have too many cats and since most of these foster kittens go to homes where they are the only cat, they can receive the attention they deserve. I already have three cats and he would have to share the love. Blip Blip deserves to be #1. Hope this helps people better understand the foster program.

Your warm touch

As for me, I always seem to be watching funny kittens & puppies or any other super cute pet videos. Yes, I admit to being a cat person. Dogs are cool but cats curl up on your keyboard when you're working and give you an excuse to take lunch. I enjoy Family Guy, love Robot Chicken, Inuyasha, Naruto (most anime), American Idol and Planet Earth (in HD). The Office is a great comedy but very embarrassing (secret crush on Dwight).
 
And now a little rant... I've noticed something about females in my generation.

‚òÖUpdate‚òÖ Blip Blip was a ""foster"" kitten with my local Humane Society. After returning him, he was adopted the very next day =^-^=

‚òÖ Also ‚òÖ there seems to be some confusion about why Blip Blip was returned to the Humane Society. I am a foster parent who takes in kittens who are too young to adopt out and provides a safe & loving environment until they reach an adoptable age. Blip Blip was never in any danger of being destroyed. Once a foster kitten is returned, the Humane Society makes potential adopters fill out a questionnaire to ensure that they are sincere and capable. Also, the adopter must pay an adoption fee of $100+ to the Humane Society. Fostering is charitable and I receive no pay. If I chose to keep my fosters I would have too many cats and since most of these foster kittens go to homes where they are the only cat, they can receive the attention they deserve. I already have three cats and he would have to share the love. Blip Blip deserves to be #1. Hope this helps people better understand the foster program.
______________________________ ____ 

I was practicing a song when my foster kitty, Blip Blip, made himself at home. So, out came the camera, song ready or not (not, I know there are some  picking and timing glitches but hey, opportunity came a knockin'. I wasn't even planning on releasing this song. I was just practicing when this little guy made me rush for the camera). 

This is not so much a music video but an ode to Blip Blip and a perfect way to put together all his film clips. I raised him from just 3 weeks old to about 4 months old. He's a dear and it was very hard to return him to the Humane Society(I'm part of their foster program). But, I knew he'd make a great companion for some lucky person and I already have plenty of cats. He's a little thinker and I miss him.

You'll always be here in my heart  

I lie still
My heart chills
Soft breeze flies
Loving riverside

I'll always keep you in my heart

Smokey wine
We've lost time
Mountains near
I'll always hold you dear

I'll always keep you in my heart

Your blue eyes 
Smiling into mine
Your warm touch 
Can never be too much

I'll always keep you in my heart

Sun will shine 
As our times pass by
Hands held laced
I'll always see your face

I'll always keep you in my heart

I started posting videos so I can share my music with people all over the world.

As for me, I always seem to be watching funny kittens & puppies or any other super cute pet videos. Yes, I admit to being a cat person. Dogs are cool but cats curl up on your keyboard when you're working and give you an excuse to take lunch. I enjoy Family Guy, love Robot Chicken, Inuyasha, Naruto (most anime), American Idol and Planet Earth (in HD). The Office is a great comedy but very embarrassing (secret crush on Dwight).
 
And now a little rant... I've noticed something about females in my generation. I live by a skate-park and everytime I pass-by ""busty teen babes"" just sit idly on their hands, acting sexy, as guys perform skateboard tricks and stunts (not idle). The girls' dress code is the ""all empowering"" ""look at my breasts"" camisoles or the popular ""I just got boobs"" tank top, paired with hot ultra low rider ""look at my pubic bone"" jeans, thong or g-string. Being half nude sex objects for boys to show off to one another is a dead-end road.

‚òÖUpdate‚òÖ Blip Blip was a ""foster"" kitten with my local Humane Society. After returning him, he was adopted the very next day =^-^=

‚òÖ Also ‚òÖ there seems to be some confusion about why Blip Blip was returned to the Humane Society. I am a foster parent who takes in kittens who are too young to adopt out and provides a safe & loving environment until they reach an adoptable age. Blip Blip was never in any danger of being destroyed. Once a foster kitten is returned, the Humane Society makes potential adopters fill out a questionnaire to ensure that they are sincere and capable. Also, the adopter must pay an adoption fee of $100+ to the Humane Society. Fostering is charitable and I receive no pay. If I chose to keep my fosters I would have too many cats and since most of these foster kittens go to homes where they are the only cat, they can receive the attention they deserve. I already have three cats and he would have to share the love. Blip Blip deserves to be #1. Hope this helps people better understand the foster program.
______________________________ ____ 

I was practicing a song when my foster kitty, Blip Blip, made himself at home. So, out came the camera, song ready or not (not, I know there are some  picking and timing glitches but hey, opportunity came a knockin'. I wasn't even planning on releasing this song. I was just practicing when this little guy made me rush for the camera). 

This is not so much a music video but an ode to Blip Blip and a perfect way to put together all his film clips. I raised him from just 3 weeks old to about 4 months old. He's a dear and it was very hard to return him to the Humane Society(I'm part of their foster program). But, I knew he'd make a great companion for some lucky person and I already have plenty of cats. He's a little thinker and I miss him.

You'll always be here in my heart  

I lie still
My heart chills
Soft breeze flies
Loving riverside

I'll always keep you in my heart

Smokey wine
We've lost time
Mountains near
I'll always hold you dear

I'll always keep you in my heart

Your blue eyes 
Smiling into mine
Your warm touch 
Can never be too much

I'll always keep you in my heart

Sun will shine 
As our times pass by
Hands held laced
I'll always see your face

I'll always keep you in my heart


______________________________ ____

I started posting videos so I can share my music with people all over the world.

As for me, I always seem to be watching funny kittens & puppies or any other super cute pet videos. Yes, I admit to being a cat person. Dogs are cool but cats curl up on your keyboard when you're working and give you an excuse to take lunch. I enjoy Family Guy, love Robot Chicken, Inuyasha, Naruto (most anime), American Idol and Planet Earth (in HD). The Office is a great comedy but very embarrassing (secret crush on Dwight).
 
And now a little rant... I've noticed something about females in my generation. I live by a skate-park and everytime I pass-by ""busty teen babes"" just sit idly on their hands, acting sexy, as guys perform skateboard tricks and stunts (not idle). The girls' dress code is the ""all empowering"" ""look at my breasts"" camisoles or the popular ""I just got boobs"" tank top, paired with hot ultra low rider ""look at my pubic bone"" jeans, thong or g-string. Being half nude sex objects for boys to show off to one another is a dead-end road.

Anyway, hope I didn't bore you but I'm a yapper.

‚òÖUpdate‚òÖ Blip Blip was a ""foster"" kitten with my local Humane Society. After returning him, he was adopted the very next day =^-^=

‚òÖ Also ‚òÖ there seems to be some confusion about why Blip Blip was returned to the Humane Society. I am a foster parent who takes in kittens who are too young to adopt out and provides a safe & loving environment until they reach an adoptable age. Blip Blip was never in any danger of being destroyed. Once a foster kitten is returned, the Humane Society makes potential adopters fill out a questionnaire to ensure that they are sincere and capable. Also, the adopter must pay an adoption fee of $100+ to the Humane Society. Fostering is charitable and I receive no pay. If I chose to keep my fosters I would have too many cats and since most of these foster kittens go to homes where they are the only cat, they can receive the attention they deserve. I already have three cats and he would have to share the love. Blip Blip deserves to be #1. Hope this helps people better understand the foster program.
______________________________ ____ 

I was practicing a song when my foster kitty, Blip Blip, made himself at home. So, out came the camera, song ready or not (not, I know there are some  picking and timing glitches but hey, opportunity came a knockin'. I wasn't even planning on releasing this song. I was just practicing when this little guy made me rush for the camera). 

This is not so much a music video but an ode to Blip Blip and a perfect way to put together all his film clips. I raised him from just 3 weeks old to about 4 months old. He's a dear and it was very hard to return him to the Humane Society(I'm part of their foster program). But, I knew he'd make a great companion for some lucky person and I already have plenty of cats. He's a little thinker and I miss him.

You'll always be here in my heart  

I lie still
My heart chills
Soft breeze flies
Loving riverside

I'll always keep you in my heart

Smokey wine
We've lost time
Mountains near
I'll always hold you dear

I'll always keep you in my heart

Your blue eyes 
Smiling into mine
Your warm touch 
Can never be too much

I'll always keep you in my heart

Sun will shine 
As our times pass by
Hands held laced
I'll always see your face

I'll always keep you in my heart

Woo!  Best day ever!

Here are the lyrics (also on the goremy.com site):


Well it's that time of year, time for making a team
Time for dippin' in the dip and then be scrapin it clean
You don't even own a rap album, you're a hater, you mean?
I got more 50 Cent than a newspaper machine

Well it's fantasy football, and Manning be took y'all
But I got me the next highest pick
It ain't the dog in the fight, it's the fight in the dog
And if you don't believe me, ask Michael Vick

Well we're all online and we be drafting, G
Have a peak at my fantasy magazine
Hey the 'zine ain't supreme, I got stats n' sheets
I ain't tradin' LaDanian, so quit asking me

People want my third pick but I ain't having that
Because you know I gotta take Mike Vanderjagt
Yo, what's the deal, Remz?  Another pick from Buffalo?
Yeah, I'm picking up more bills than Pacman Jones

Rounds winding down, I'm finding out
I'm gonna need another wide out, so I'm whining now
Folks on the clock, Colts on the block
Can't tell if Randle El is da bomb or not

‚òÖUpdate‚òÖ Blip Blip was a ""foster"" kitten with my local Humane Society. After returning him, he was adopted the very next day =^-^=

‚òÖ Also ‚òÖ there seems to be some confusion about why Blip Blip was returned to the Humane Society. I am a foster parent who takes in kittens who are too young to adopt out and provides a safe & loving environment until they reach an adoptable age. Blip Blip was never in any danger of being destroyed. Once a foster kitten is returned, the Humane Society makes potential adopters fill out a questionnaire to ensure that they are sincere and capable. Also, the adopter must pay an adoption fee of $100+ to the Humane Society. Fostering is charitable and I receive no pay. If I chose to keep my fosters I would have too many cats and since most of these foster kittens go to homes where they are the only cat, they can receive the attention they deserve. I already have three cats and he would have to share the love. Blip Blip deserves to be #1. Hope this helps people better understand the foster program.
______________________________ ____ 

I was practicing a song when my foster kitty, Blip Blip, made himself at home. So, out came the camera, song ready or not (not, I know there are some  picking and timing glitches but hey, opportunity came a knockin'. I wasn't even planning on releasing this song. I was just practicing when this little guy made me rush for the camera). 

This is not so much a music video but an ode to Blip Blip and a perfect way to put together all his film clips. I raised him from just 3 weeks old to about 4 months old. He's a dear and it was very hard to return him to the Humane Society(I'm part of their foster program). But, I knew he'd make a great companion for some lucky person and I already have plenty of cats. He's a little thinker and I miss him.

""Riverside""
words & music by Mary Win
copyright 2007

You'll always be here in my heart  

I lie still
My heart chills
Soft breeze flies
Loving riverside

I'll always keep you in my heart

Smokey wine
We've lost time
Mountains near
I'll always hold you dear

I'll always keep you in my heart

Your blue eyes 
Smiling into mine
Your warm touch 
Can never be too much

I'll always keep you in my heart

Sun will shine 
As our times pass by
Hands held laced
I'll always see your face

I'll always keep you in my heart


______________________________ ____

I started posting videos so I can share my music with people all over the world.

As for me, I always seem to be watching funny kittens & puppies or any other super cute pet videos. Yes, I admit to being a cat person. Dogs are cool but cats curl up on your keyboard when you're working and give you an excuse to take lunch. I enjoy Family Guy, love Robot Chicken, Inuyasha, Naruto (most anime), American Idol and Planet Earth (in HD). The Office is a great comedy but very embarrassing (secret crush on Dwight).
 
And now a little rant... I've noticed something about females in my generation. I live by a skate-park and everytime I pass-by ""busty teen babes"" just sit idly on their hands, acting sexy, as guys perform skateboard tricks and stunts (not idle). The girls' dress code is the ""all empowering"" ""look at my breasts"" camisoles or the popular ""I just got boobs"" tank top, paired with hot ultra low rider ""look at my pubic bone"" jeans, thong or g-string. Being half nude sex objects for boys to show off to one another is a dead-end road.

Anyway, hope I didn't bore you but I'm a yapper.

Well it's that time of year, time for making a team

Well it's fantasy football, and Manning be took y'all
But I got me the next highest pick
It ain't the dog in the fight, it's the fight in the dog
And if you don't believe me, ask Michael Vick

Well we're all online and we be drafting, G
Have a peak at my fantasy magazine
Hey the 'zine ain't supreme, I got stats n' sheets
I ain't tradin' LaDanian, so quit asking me

People want my third pick but I ain't having that
Because you know I gotta take Mike Vanderjagt
Yo, what's the deal, Remz?  Another pick from Buffalo?
Yeah, I'm picking up more bills than Pacman Jones

Rounds winding down, I'm finding out
I'm gonna need another wide out, so I'm whining now

Well it's that time of year, time for making a team
Time for dippin' in the dip and then be scrapin it clean
You don't even own a rap album, you're a hater, you mean?
I got more 50 Cent than a newspaper machine

Well it's fantasy football, and Manning be took y'all
But I got me the next highest pick
It ain't the dog in the fight, it's the fight in the dog
And if you don't believe me, ask Michael Vick

Well we're all online and we be drafting, G
Have a peak at my fantasy magazine
Hey the 'zine ain't supreme, I got stats n' sheets
I ain't tradin' LaDanian, so quit asking me

People want my third pick but I ain't having that
Because you know I gotta take Mike Vanderjagt
Yo, what's the deal, Remz?  Another pick from Buffalo?
Yeah, I'm picking up more bills than Pacman Jones

Rounds winding down, I'm finding out
I'm gonna need another wide out, so I'm whining now
Folks on the clock, Colts on the block
Can't tell if Randle El is da bomb or not

Head-to-head league with me?  Boy, you're playing with fire
Because I am the king of the waiver wire
Picked up Jones-Drew before he ever got a run
And I cut Tank Johnson 'fore he ever bought a gun

I know the matchups man, and they ain't hard to pick
Never hear me say ""man, I should've started him.""
Don't need no expert picks, that's appalling, see
Sunday morning Ron Jaworski be calling me

My war room setup cannot be bested

Woo!  Best day ever!

Here are the lyrics (also on the goremy.com site):


Well it's that time of year, time for making a team
Time for dippin' in the dip and then be scrapin it clean
You don't even own a rap album, you're a hater, you mean?
I got more 50 Cent than a newspaper machine

Well it's fantasy football, and Manning be took y'all
But I got me the next highest pick
It ain't the dog in the fight, it's the fight in the dog
And if you don't believe me, ask Michael Vick

Well we're all online and we be drafting, G
Have a peak at my fantasy magazine
Hey the 'zine ain't supreme, I got stats n' sheets
I ain't tradin' LaDanian, so quit asking me

People want my third pick but I ain't having that
Because you know I gotta take Mike Vanderjagt
Yo, what's the deal, Remz?  Another pick from Buffalo?
Yeah, I'm picking up more bills than Pacman Jones

Rounds winding down, I'm finding out
I'm gonna need another wide out, so I'm whining now
Folks on the clock, Colts on the block
Can't tell if Randle El is da bomb or not

Head-to-head league with me?  Boy, you're playing with fire
Because I am the king of the waiver wire
Picked up Jones-Drew before he ever got a run
And I cut Tank Johnson 'fore he ever bought a gun

I know the matchups man, and they ain't hard to pick
Never hear me say ""man, I should've started him.""
Don't need no expert picks, that's appalling, see
Sunday morning Ron Jaworski be calling me

My war room setup cannot be bested
Checking out the 'net to see who got arrested
My players play even if they're sore or not
I don't cheer for teams, I just hope they score a lot

Well my starting five'll make you start to cry

Well it's that time of year, time for making a team
Time for dippin' in the dip and then be scrapin it clean
You don't even own a rap album, you're a hater, you mean?
I got more 50 Cent than a newspaper machine

Well it's fantasy football, and Manning be took y'all
But I got me the next highest pick

Well we're all online and we be drafting, G
Have a peak at my fantasy magazine
Hey the 'zine ain't supreme, I got stats n' sheets
I ain't tradin' LaDanian, so quit asking me

People want my third pick but I ain't having that
Because you know I gotta take Mike Vanderjagt
Yo, what's the deal, Remz?  Another pick from Buffalo?
Yeah, I'm picking up more bills than Pacman Jones

Rounds winding down, I'm finding out
I'm gonna need another wide out, so I'm whining now
Folks on the clock, Colts on the block
Can't tell if Randle El is da bomb or not

Head-to-head league with me?  Boy, you're playing with fire
Because I am the king of the waiver wire
Picked up Jones-Drew before he ever got a run
And I cut Tank Johnson 'fore he ever bought a gun

I know the matchups man, and they ain't hard to pick
Never hear me say ""man, I should've started him.""
Don't need no expert picks, that's appalling, see
Sunday morning Ron Jaworski be calling me

My war room setup cannot be bested
Checking out the 'net to see who got arrested
My players play even if they're sore or not
I don't cheer for teams, I just hope they score a lot

Well my starting five'll make you start to cry
And I'll beat you even if my starters got a bye
Picking up top players even in the late rounds
Got more sleepers here than the Heaven's Gate house

Try to trade with me, I'm gonna clean you out

Bowling for Sandercoe,119,"WINNER!! of Justin Sandercoe's ""most innovative use of a guitar"" competition. :)

To answer some of the more commonly asked questions:

The music was written specially for the film by Loic Desjardins. It doesn't have a name that I know of and it's not available anywhere besides this film at the moment.

I used a Panasonic NV-GS280 camcorder, Stop Motion Pro, Photoshop and Sony Vegas to make the film. And some Lego. My other Lego films were shot with a Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000 webcam - a pretty cheap alternative.

It's all stop motion - 15 frames per second, so around 1800 frames altogether. I filmed it over about three days, then spent about a day fiddling about editing and masking and stuff.

The bouncing ball effect is explained here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v =2xfnAQnYCHs

Don't forget you can catch Justin's guitar lessons at http://www.justinguitar.com - it's all free and there's plenty of videos starting right from the basics.

I think that's about it. Thanks for all the comments so far. Keep them coming :)",531714,0ldScratch,gkyeFA8bPeU,,,4.5,,,1189260704000,"Sat, 08 Sep 2007 14:11:44 GMT",20070908141144,Film & Animation,,

Well it's that time of year, time for making a team
Time for dippin' in the dip and then be scrapin it clean
You don't even own a rap album, you're a hater, you mean?
I got more 50 Cent than a newspaper machine

Well it's fantasy football, and Manning be took y'all
But I got me the next highest pick
It ain't the dog in the fight, it's the fight in the dog
And if you don't believe me, ask Michael Vick

Well we're all online and we be drafting, G
Have a peak at my fantasy magazine
Hey the 'zine ain't supreme, I got stats n' sheets
I ain't tradin' LaDanian, so quit asking me

People want my third pick but I ain't having that
Because you know I gotta take Mike Vanderjagt
Yo, what's the deal, Remz?  Another pick from Buffalo?
Yeah, I'm picking up more bills than Pacman Jones

Rounds winding down, I'm finding out
I'm gonna need another wide out, so I'm whining now
Folks on the clock, Colts on the block
Can't tell if Randle El is da bomb or not

Head-to-head league with me?  Boy, you're playing with fire
Because I am the king of the waiver wire
Picked up Jones-Drew before he ever got a run
And I cut Tank Johnson 'fore he ever bought a gun

I know the matchups man, and they ain't hard to pick
Never hear me say ""man, I should've started him.""
Don't need no expert picks, that's appalling, see
Sunday morning Ron Jaworski be calling me

My war room setup cannot be bested
Checking out the 'net to see who got arrested
My players play even if they're sore or not
I don't cheer for teams, I just hope they score a lot

Well my starting five'll make you start to cry
And I'll beat you even if my starters got a bye
Picking up top players even in the late rounds
Got more sleepers here than the Heaven's Gate house

Try to trade with me, I'm gonna clean you out
Take your top running back and the mortgage to your house
Think I'm gonna play nice?  Well then you don't know me

Bowling for Sandercoe,119,"WINNER!! of Justin Sandercoe's ""most innovative use of a guitar"" competition. :)

To answer some of the more commonly asked questions:

The music was written specially for the film by Loic Desjardins. It doesn't have a name that I know of and it's not available anywhere besides this film at the moment.

I used a Panasonic NV-GS280 camcorder, Stop Motion Pro, Photoshop and Sony Vegas to make the film. And some Lego. My other Lego films were shot with a Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000 webcam - a pretty cheap alternative.

It's all stop motion - 15 frames per second, so around 1800 frames altogether. I filmed it over about three days, then spent about a day fiddling about editing and masking and stuff.

The bouncing ball effect is explained here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v =2xfnAQnYCHs

Bowling for Sandercoe,119,"WINNER!! of Justin Sandercoe's ""most innovative use of a guitar"" competition. :)

To answer some of the more commonly asked questions:

The music was written specially for the film by Loic Desjardins. It doesn't have a name that I know of and it's not available anywhere besides this film at the moment.

I used a Panasonic NV-GS280 camcorder, Stop Motion Pro, Photoshop and Sony Vegas to make the film. And some Lego. My other Lego films were shot with a Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000 webcam - a pretty cheap alternative.

It's all stop motion - 15 frames per second, so around 1800 frames altogether. I filmed it over about three days, then spent about a day fiddling about editing and masking and stuff.

The bouncing ball effect is explained here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v =2xfnAQnYCHs

Emergency in Darfur,2750,"Emergency in Darfur, broadcast premiere on HDNet on Tuesday, September 25 - 10:00 PM ET/ 7:00 PM PT- http://www.hd.net

Darfur, Sudan is being called the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. Tens of thousands of people have died. Two million more have been forced to flee their homes and livelihoods. For these innocent civilians, living on the edge of survival, their only hope is the dwindling number of humanitarian organizations willing to risk the dangers on the ground in Darfur to provide relief.  International Medical Corps was one of the first relief organizations to arrive on the scene in Darfur, and remains there to this day.  Established in 1984 by volunteer doctors and nurses, IMC provides help in more than 25 countries and regions worldwide that have been ravaged by war and disaster. IMC's network of some 5,000 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals makes it one of the fastest, most effective emergency response agencies in the world.  In Darfur, IMC has been providing critical emergency medical services to a target population of about 300,000. This includes operating seven primary health care centers and two mobile clinics aimed at improving access to health care, nutritional assistance, and clean water and sanitation. These facilities provide family medicine; pre-natal, maternal, and child health care; immunizations; referrals and transportation for secondary care; and health and hygiene education. IMC also has rehabilitated local health care facilities, providing medicines, supplies and health care training to local professionals.

Emergency in Darfur,2750,"Premieres on HDNet Tues. Sep. 25 10:00 PM ET 
Produced by Video Action Aid - visit http://videoactionaid.com

Darfur, Sudan is being called the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. Tens of thousands of people have died. Two million more have been forced to flee their homes and livelihoods. For these innocent civilians, living on the edge of survival, their only hope is the dwindling number of humanitarian organizations willing to risk the dangers on the ground in Darfur to provide relief.  International Medical Corps was one of the first relief organizations to arrive on the scene in Darfur, and remains there to this day.  Established in 1984 by volunteer doctors and nurses, IMC provides help in more than 25 countries and regions worldwide that have been ravaged by war and disaster. IMC's network of some 5,000 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals makes it one of the fastest, most effective emergency response agencies in the world.  In Darfur, IMC has been providing critical emergency medical services to a target population of about 300,000. This includes operating seven primary health care centers and two mobile clinics aimed at improving access to health care, nutritional assistance, and clean water and sanitation. These facilities provide family medicine; pre-natal, maternal, and child health care; immunizations; referrals and transportation for secondary care; and health and hygiene education. IMC also has rehabilitated local health care facilities, providing medicines, supplies and health care training to local professionals.  For more information visit http://www.imcworldwide.org.

VBS bumped into her a few months ago and discovered that she has been working on a film in West Virginia, a sort of impressionistic account of the current environmental catastrophe in the Appalachian Mountains. Mining companies are destroying entire mountains in order to get at the coal inside them. Quickly and efficiently, the oldest mountain range in the world is being systematically obliterated.

Can Your Film Change the World?,150,"Here's a big idea: to use the power of film to bring the world a little closer together. We're divided by borders, race, religion, conflict... but most of all by misunderstanding and mistrust.  Pangea Day seeks to overcome that -- to help people see themselves in others -- through the power of film.

On May 10, 2008 -- Pangea Day -- sites in Cairo, Dharamsala, Jerusalem, Kigali, London, New York City, Ramallah and Rio de Janeiro will be linked to produce a 4-hour program of powerful films, visionary speakers, and uplifting music. The program will be broadcast live to the world through the Internet, television, digital cinemas, and mobile phones.

Your film could be part of it.  The online video revolution has helped spawn a new generation of grass-roots film-makers worldwide.  Much of the output, of course, is terrible. But hidden in there are amazing talents capable of using film to astonishing effect...  and capable of telling stories that can create powerful bonds between us.

So ask yourself this. If you had the entire world's attention for just  a few minutes, what story would you tell?  Perhaps you think the world looks at you, your country and your culture... and just doesn't understand. Then do something about it. Make a film and upload it here http://www.youtube.com/group/p angeaday.   You never know. It could end up bringing millions of people that bit closer together. 

Pangea is the name of the original super-continent which contained all the world's land mass before the continents started splitting apart 250 million years ago.  We're launching Pangea Day with the vision that the people of the world can begin to overcome their divisions, and that the power of film can help make it possible.

Movies can't change the world. But the people who watch them can.

Emergency in Darfur,2750,"Premieres on HDNet Tues. Sep. 25 10:00 PM ET 
Produced by Video Action Aid - visit http://videoactionaid.com
YOU CAN HELP - visit http://imcworldwide.org

Darfur, Sudan is being called the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. Tens of thousands of people have died. Two million more have been forced to flee their homes and livelihoods. For these innocent civilians, living on the edge of survival, their only hope is the dwindling number of humanitarian organizations willing to risk the dangers on the ground in Darfur to provide relief.  International Medical Corps was one of the first relief organizations to arrive on the scene in Darfur, and remains there to this day.  Established in 1984 by volunteer doctors and nurses, IMC provides help in more than 25 countries and regions worldwide that have been ravaged by war and disaster. IMC's network of some 5,000 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals makes it one of the fastest, most effective emergency response agencies in the world.  In Darfur, IMC has been providing critical emergency medical services to a target population of about 300,000. This includes operating seven primary health care centers and two mobile clinics aimed at improving access to health care, nutritional assistance, and clean water and sanitation. These facilities provide family medicine; pre-natal, maternal, and child health care; immunizations; referrals and transportation for secondary care; and health and hygiene education. IMC also has rehabilitated local health care facilities, providing medicines, supplies and health care training to local professionals.  For more information visit http://www.imcworldwide.org.

MIzzDAIZYD - Tainted ( Original )


TAINTED

Alone tonight,
I called you up and said hey boy, come over here
and spend the night baby with me
but then i realised it was a bad idea,
it's just the wine talking and another day will come
and our issues will still be here

here we go again,
is it ever gonna change?

Everything about you and me
Seems so dated, it's so tainted
Everything about you and me
Seems so hazy, it's so crazy
Could've been sweet, but there was just a small stain
Slightly incomplete
There's something missing, something missing
We could try again but the damage still remains
I dont know how to change
That's why it's over
Everything about you and me
Seems so jaded, it's so tainted

Dont wanna fight
I called you up and said hey boy stay over there
cause tonight i'm needing room to breathe
You saying it's alright, gonna see and old girlfriend
Goin' out for the evening and another day will come
when you're thinking 'i should have been there'

here we go again
are you ever gonna change?

Everything about you and me
Seems so dated, it's so tainted
Everything about you and me
Seems so hazy, it's so crazy
Could have been sweet, but there was just a small stain

Oh, oh, oooohh.....

It's a tad throwaway but I sometimes like that in music - it's not good to take yourself too seriously. I may add to it at a later date..

This goes out to all those lovely people who subscribed to my channel and, in their comments, remarked that my vocals should be pushed up (*cough*, bobsaguitarist..) Hope I didn't disappoint 

:|  

_________________________
The Ballad of The Existentialist

There's a world outside that window
Would you step into the sun?
Chasing shadows can't be in you
When the battle has been won

Try so hard to verbalise it
Understand it for yourself
Just find your feet and stand beside me
Don't put yourself back on the shelf

Just know that I'll be by my side, you..
The world is sinking deep inside..

Paint a picture, tell a story
Leave a trace behind to see
In years to come you'll call me boring
In your reflection you'll see me

Just know that I'll be by your side, you..
The world is sinking deep inside..

MIzzDAIZYD - Tainted ( Original )


TAINTED

Alone tonight,
I called you up and said hey boy, come over here
and spend the night baby with me
but then i realised it was a bad idea,
it's just the wine talking and another day will come
and our issues will still be here

here we go again,
is it ever gonna change?

Everything about you and me
Seems so dated, it's so tainted
Everything about you and me
Seems so hazy, it's so crazy
Could've been sweet, but there was just a small stain
Slightly incomplete
There's something missing, something missing
We could try again but the damage still remains
I dont know how to change
That's why it's over
Everything about you and me
Seems so jaded, it's so tainted

Dont wanna fight
I called you up and said hey boy stay over there
cause tonight i'm needing room to breathe
You saying it's alright, gonna see and old girlfriend
Goin' out for the evening and another day will come
when you're thinking 'i should have been there'

here we go again
are you ever gonna change?

Everything about you and me
Seems so dated, it's so tainted
Everything about you and me
Seems so hazy, it's so crazy
Could have been sweet, but there was just a small stain
Slightly incomplete
There's something missing, something missing
We could try again but the damage still remains
I dont know how to change
That's why it's over
Everything about you and me
Seems so jaded, it's so tainted

Oh, oh, oooohh.....

here we go again
are you ever gonna change?

Everything about you and me
Seems so dated, it's so tainted

			From the www.VBS.tv series in 4 parts.

Meredith Danluck is a New York artist, director, and all-around amazing person who has a killer collection of power tools. VBS bumped into her a few months ago and discovered that she has been working on a film in West Virginia, a sort of impressionistic account of the current environmental catastrophe in the Appalachian Mountains. Mining companies are destroying entire mountains in order to get at the coal inside them. Quickly and efficiently, the oldest mountain range in the world is being systematically obliterated. We sent Meredith and VBS correspondent Derrick Beckles to the hills and hollers of West Virginia to show us what the end of the world looks like.

Can Your Film Change the World?,150,"Here's a big idea: Pangea Day plans to use the power of film to bring the world a little closer together. We're divided by borders, race, religion, conflict... but most of all by misunderstanding and mistrust.  Pangea Day seeks to overcome that -- to help people see themselves in others -- through the power of film.

On May 10, 2008 -- Pangea Day -- sites in Cairo, Dharamsala, Jerusalem, Kigali, London, New York City, Ramallah and Rio de Janeiro will be linked to produce a 4-hour program of powerful films, visionary speakers, and uplifting music. The program will be broadcast live to the world through the Internet, television, digital cinemas, and mobile phones.

Your film could be part of it.  The online video revolution has helped spawn a new generation of grass-roots film-makers worldwide.  Much of the output, of course, is mediocre. But hidden in there are amazing talents capable of using film to astonishing effect...  and capable of telling stories that can create powerful bonds between us.

So ask yourself this. If you had the entire world's attention for just  a few minutes, what story would you tell?  Perhaps you think the world looks at you, your country and your culture... and just doesn't understand. Then do something about it. Make a film and upload it here http://www.youtube.com/group/p angeaday.   You never know. It could end up bringing millions of people that bit closer together. 

Pangea is the name of the original super-continent which contained all the world's land mass before the continents started splitting apart 250 million years ago.  We're launching Pangea Day with the vision that the people of the world can begin to overcome their divisions, and that the power of film can help make it possible.

Movies can't change the world. But the people who watch them can.

Emergency in Darfur,2750,"Premieres on HDNet Tues. Sep. 25 10:00 PM ET 
Produced by Video Action Aid - visit http://videoactionaid.com
YOU CAN HELP - visit http://imcworldwide.org

Darfur, Sudan is being called the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. Tens of thousands of people have died. Two million more have been forced to flee their homes and livelihoods. For these innocent civilians, living on the edge of survival, their only hope is the dwindling number of humanitarian organizations willing to risk the dangers on the ground in Darfur to provide relief.  International Medical Corps was one of the first relief organizations to arrive on the scene in Darfur, and remains there to this day.  Established in 1984 by volunteer doctors and nurses, IMC provides help in more than 25 countries and regions worldwide that have been ravaged by war and disaster. IMC's network of some 5,000 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals makes it one of the fastest, most effective emergency response agencies in the world.  In Darfur, IMC has been providing critical emergency medical services to a target population of about 300,000. This includes operating seven primary health care centers and two mobile clinics aimed at improving access to health care, nutritional assistance, and clean water and sanitation. These facilities provide family medicine; pre-natal, maternal, and child health care; immunizations; referrals and transportation for secondary care; and health and hygiene education. IMC also has rehabilitated local health care facilities, providing medicines, supplies and health care training to local professionals.  For more information visit http://www.imcworldwide.org.

The Ballad of The Existentialist

There's a world outside that window
Would you step into the sun?
Chasing shadows can't be in you
When the battle has been won

Try so hard to verbalise it
Understand it for yourself
Just find your feet and stand beside me
Don't put yourself back on the shelf

Just know that I'll be by my side, you..
The world is sinking deep inside..

Paint a picture, tell a story
Leave a trace behind to see
In years to come you'll call me boring
In your reflection you'll see me

Just know that I'll be by your side, you..
The world is sinking deep inside..

			From the www.VBS.tv series in 4 parts.

Meredith Danluck is a New York artist, director, and all-around amazing person who has a killer collection of power tools. VBS bumped into her a few months ago and discovered that she has been working on a film in West Virginia, a sort of impressionistic account of the current environmental catastrophe in the Appalachian Mountains. Mining companies are destroying entire mountains in order to get at the coal inside them. Quickly and efficiently, the oldest mountain range in the world is being systematically obliterated. We sent Meredith and VBS correspondent Derrick Beckles to the hills and hollers of West Virginia to show us what the end of the world looks like.

Can Your Film Change the World?,150,"Here's a big idea: Pangea Day plans to use the power of film to bring the world a little closer together. We're divided by borders, race, religion, conflict... but most of all by misunderstanding and mistrust.  Pangea Day seeks to overcome that -- to help people see themselves in others -- through the power of film.

On May 10, 2008 -- Pangea Day -- sites in Cairo, Dharamsala, Jerusalem, Kigali, London, New York City, Ramallah and Rio de Janeiro will be linked to produce a 4-hour program of powerful films, visionary speakers, and uplifting music. The program will be broadcast live to the world through the Internet, television, digital cinemas, and mobile phones.

Your film could be part of it.  The online video revolution has helped spawn a new generation of grass-roots film-makers worldwide.  Much of the output, of course, is mediocre. But hidden in there are amazing talents capable of using film to astonishing effect...  and capable of telling stories that can create powerful bonds between us.

So ask yourself this. If you had the entire world's attention for just  a few minutes, what story would you tell?  Perhaps you think the world looks at you, your country and your culture... and just doesn't understand. Then do something about it. Make a film and upload it here http://www.youtube.com/group/p angeaday.   You never know. It could end up bringing millions of people that bit closer together. 

Pangea is the name of the original super-continent which contained all the world's land mass before the continents started splitting apart 250 million years ago.  We're launching Pangea Day with the vision that the people of the world can begin to overcome their divisions, and that the power of film can help make it possible.

Movies can't change the world. But the people who watch them can.

Emergency in Darfur,2750,"Premieres on HDNet Tues. Sep. 25 10:00 PM ET 
Produced by Video Action Aid - visit http://videoactionaid.com
YOU CAN HELP - visit http://imcworldwide.org

Darfur, Sudan is being called the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. Tens of thousands of people have died. Two million more have been forced to flee their homes and livelihoods. For these innocent civilians, living on the edge of survival, their only hope is the dwindling number of humanitarian organizations willing to risk the dangers on the ground in Darfur to provide relief.  International Medical Corps was one of the first relief organizations to arrive on the scene in Darfur, and remains there to this day.  Established in 1984 by volunteer doctors and nurses, IMC provides help in more than 25 countries and regions worldwide that have been ravaged by war and disaster. IMC's network of some 5,000 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals makes it one of the fastest, most effective emergency response agencies in the world.  In Darfur, IMC has been providing critical emergency medical services to a target population of about 300,000. This includes operating seven primary health care centers and two mobile clinics aimed at improving access to health care, nutritional assistance, and clean water and sanitation. These facilities provide family medicine; pre-natal, maternal, and child health care; immunizations; referrals and transportation for secondary care; and health and hygiene education. IMC also has rehabilitated local health care facilities, providing medicines, supplies and health care training to local professionals.  For more information visit http://www.imcworldwide.org.

And now, some lyrics:

""Homicidal Paperlilies""
written by:  The Road

Shane:
New York, New York, New York
Rhymes with ""pork"" and ""Snork""
New York, New York, New York
Oh yeah, I guess it also rhymes with ""Bjork""

Kent:
Met Bill Clinton and I told him a joke
Something 'bout a black ""manna"" ropin' a goat
That's right, I said a black ""manna"" ropin' a goat
And I told Morgan Freeman that very same joke
Then UH-OH!
Oh no, it's the Hulk!
UH-OH!
The Incredible Hulk!
That motherf***er chased me for a half hour
Bitch didn't know I had Frankenstein power!
Jammed with Tina... Then I beat her.
Hit on Madonna, stole Spielberg's seat-ah.

Spielberg:
Hey!

David:
Seat-ah?
MC David and I like to s**t!
Ass makin' sounds you'll never forget!
Dropped two stink-bombs on f***in' Joy-zee
Hey, Shane!

Shane:
Yeah, David?

David:
You f***in' annoy me!
Walkin' down the street in New York Sit-ay
Passin' all the homeless people, got no pit-ay
Got a lot of signs that say ""gimme a dolla""
Crack costs more, man, why do they botha?
Countin' hobos down in Soho
Met Darryl Hammond, he's a honky mo-fo!

Shane:
Honky mo-fo?  Really?

David:
Kent got away with f***in' ""seat-ah""!

Shane:
Oh yeah.
777 and my name is Shane!
Look out below, I'm droppin' names!
We got Crossmack, Paperlilies, DentonUSA
KatieBlog, Tony Stockert, Hill88
Well they all bow down when The Road walks in!

The Road:
October Road wins again!

Shane:
Signin' autographs, next thing ya' know
Me and Spricket24 got on the dance flow

(wicked breakdown)

Shane:
Paperlilies say she gonna stab me in the face!

Kent and David:
Paperlilies say she gonna stab you in the face?

Shane:
Yeah, Paperlilies say she gonna stab me in the face!

Kent and David:
Paperlilies say she gonna stab you in the face?

Shane:
Yeah!

The Road:
Paperlilies say she gonna stab me in the face!
Paperlilies say she gonna stab me in the FACE!
Paperlilies say she gonna STAB ME IN THE FACE!!
Paperlilies say she gonna stab me in the face.

Kent:
Why?

Nothing more. 

NB: Personally I don't think this video is anything great or noteworthy and for those who feel the need to point out how much it sucks and is a waste of their good time I hope you see the irony in the fact that it probably took you longer to make that negative comment then it did to watch the 16 seconds of footage.

Emergency in Darfur,2750,"Premieres on HDNet Tues. Sep. 25 10:00 PM ET 
Produced by Video Action Aid - visit http://videoactionaid.com
YOU CAN HELP - visit http://imcworldwide.org

Darfur, Sudan is being called the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. Tens of thousands of people have died. Two million more have been forced to flee their homes and livelihoods. For these innocent civilians, living on the edge of survival, their only hope is the dwindling number of humanitarian organizations willing to risk the dangers on the ground in Darfur to provide relief.  International Medical Corps was one of the first relief organizations to arrive on the scene in Darfur, and remains there to this day.  Established in 1984 by volunteer doctors and nurses, IMC provides help in more than 25 countries and regions worldwide that have been ravaged by war and disaster. IMC's network of some 5,000 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals makes it one of the fastest, most effective emergency response agencies in the world.  In Darfur, IMC has been providing critical emergency medical services to a target population of about 300,000. This includes operating seven primary health care centers and two mobile clinics aimed at improving access to health care, nutritional assistance, and clean water and sanitation. These facilities provide family medicine; pre-natal, maternal, and child health care; immunizations; referrals and transportation for secondary care; and health and hygiene education. IMC also has rehabilitated local health care facilities, providing medicines, supplies and health care training to local professionals.  For more information visit http://www.imcworldwide.org.

Established in 1984 by volunteer doctors and nurses, IMC provides help in more than 25 countries and regions worldwide that have been ravaged by war and disaster. IMC's network of some 5,000 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals makes it one of the fastest, most effective emergency response agencies in the world.  In Darfur, IMC has been providing critical emergency medical services to a target population of about 300,000. This includes operating seven primary health care centers and two mobile clinics aimed at improving access to health care, nutritional assistance, and clean water and sanitation. These facilities provide family medicine; pre-natal, maternal, and child health care; immunizations; referrals and transportation for secondary care; and health and hygiene education. IMC also has rehabilitated local health care facilities, providing medicines, supplies and health care training to local professionals.  For more information visit http://www.imcworldwide.org.

Extra, Extra this just in, I've been living a lie from the beginning. I told myself No no one else, now I can't help I'm laughing at this life that I am living. Tell me will the sun come out to play, I""m tired of living in this rain of Grey, with you stealing my Umbrella, ella ella Eh Eh Eh.

I've got him on my mind again and though I search I never win. I'm told that if you seek you shall find your Angel though I'm, I'm throwing most of my hope aside, but still praying I'll be found in time...

Any other day, any other time and place, you'd still be on my mind, but now I'm letting go, won't be taking this no more, I'd just be wasting my time.
Yeah you tried to show me you love me, you need me though you just deceived me and now I'm tired of waiting aimless in your arms.
Time goes by slowly, love dies, inside my soul cries, i'm holding on by breathing. I know my heart fought but it's not caught the one that it ought, Ought,. I'm letting go, I'm leaving.
If you could take alll my pain away, My tears are streaming oceans on my face, No more dreaming yesterday is yesterday. Yeah Yeah Yeah

trop facile!

Pendant mes cours d' SVT en terminale
il y avait une fille assise √† mes c√¥t√©s
comme elle √©tait femelle et que j'√©tais un m√¢le,
j'ai d√©cid√© d'en faire ma fianc√©e.
Mais n'ayant rien suivi de mes cours de bio
Pour me faire remarquer j'ai fait l'idiot:
Je me suis pench√© vers elle et j'ai d√©clar√©
les mots suivants, un peu comme ils venaient:

Oh,tel un coccolitophorid√©
coinc√© entre le tertiaire et le cr√©tac√©
les systoles de mon coeur affol√©
m'ont fait comprendre que tu es ma dulcin√©e.

Elle m'a regard√© d'un air √©bahi, j'ai eu peur d'avoir dit une connerie.
Puis son visage d'un sourire √©clatant,
me d√©voila toutes ses belles dents.
Et quand l' prof aborda l'immunologie,
c'est sur un ton d'antig√®ne, qu'elle me r√©pondit:

Si toi tu es un coccolitophorid√©
coinc√© entre le tertiaire et le cr√©tac√©, moi je suis un trilobite d√©c√©d√©
depuis au moins 200 millions d'ann√©es.

De toute √©vidence elle suivait mieux que moi
le peu de cours de bio auxquels j'√©tais l√†
Mais pendant qu'la classe dessinait les anticorps
je n'pouvais me r√©signer √† oublier son corps,
alors r√©unissant mes quelques feuilles de SVT
je suis parvenu lui r√©torquer:

le polyall√©lisme d'un g√®ne s'exprime
par la diversit√© ph√©notypique des individus,
ces quelques mots,je les d√©cl√¢me pour te dire que tu as les plus beaux yeux qu'j'ai jamais vu

Me regardant, elle a rigol√©,
et m'a r√©pondu sur un p'tit bout d'papier:

le polyall√©lisme d'un g√®ne s'exprime
par la diversit√© ph√©notypique des individus,
ces quelques mots, je sais qu'tu les imprimes
et je compte bien de voir ce soir apr√®s le bahut.

Et nous baladant sur l'√©chelle stratigraphique,
faisant fi des temps g√©ologiques

Pendant mes cours d' SVT en terminale
il y avait une fille assise √† mes c√¥t√©s
comme elle √©tait femelle et que j'√©tais un m√¢le,
j'ai d√©cid√© d'en faire ma fianc√©e.
Mais n'ayant rien suivi de mes cours de bio
Pour me faire remarquer j'ai fait l'idiot:
Je me suis pench√© vers elle et j'ai d√©clar√©
les mots suivants, un peu comme ils venaient:

Oh,tel un coccolitophorid√©
coinc√© entre le tertiaire et le cr√©tac√©
les systoles de mon coeur affol√©
m'ont fait comprendre que tu es ma dulcin√©e.

Elle m'a regard√© d'un air √©bahi, j'ai eu peur d'avoir dit une connerie.
Puis son visage d'un sourire √©clatant,
me d√©voila toutes ses belles dents.
Et quand l' prof aborda l'immunologie,
c'est sur un ton d'antig√®ne, qu'elle me r√©pondit:

Si toi tu es un coccolitophorid√©
coinc√© entre le tertiaire et le cr√©tac√©, moi je suis un trilobite d√©c√©d√©
depuis au moins 200 millions d'ann√©es.

De toute √©vidence elle suivait mieux que moi
le peu de cours de bio auxquels j'√©tais l√†
Mais pendant qu'la classe dessinait les anticorps
je n'pouvais me r√©signer √† oublier son corps,
alors r√©unissant mes quelques feuilles de SVT
je suis parvenu lui r√©torquer:

Tell me am I ever gonna find my Angel This life.
I've got him on my mind again and though I search I never win. I'm told that if you seek you shall find your Angel though I'm, I'm throwing most of my hope aside, but still praying I'll be found in time...

Extra, Extra this just in, I've been living a lie from the beginning. I told myself No no one else, now I can't help I'm laughing at this life that I am living. Tell me will the sun come out to play, I""m tired of living in this rain of Grey, with you stealing my Umbrella, ella ella Eh Eh Eh.
It's been years, still I""m here wishing waiting wanting more, What he said he would give me.
Now the nights turned today carved in words, Displayed, Framed ""I vow to you I""m ready"". If you could take this pain away, My tears are streaming oceans on my face, No more dreaming yesterday is yerterday. YEAH YEAH YEAH... 

Tell me am I ever gonna find my Angel This life.
I've got him on my mind again and though I search I never win. I'm told that if you seek you shall find your Angel though I'm, I'm throwing most of my hope aside, but still praying I'll be found in time...

Any other day, any other time and place, you'd still be on my mind, but now I'm letting go, won't be taking this no more, I'd just be wasting my time.
Yeah you tried to show me you love me, you need me though you just deceived me and now I'm tired of waiting aimless in your arms.
Time goes by slowly, love dies, inside my soul cries, i'm holding on by breathing. I know my heart fought but it's not caught the one that it ought, Ought,. I'm letting go, I'm leaving.
If you could take alll my pain away, My tears are streaming oceans on my face, No more dreaming yesterday is yesterday. Yeah Yeah Yeah

Tell me am I ever gonna find my ""Angel"" this life, I've got him on my mind again and, and though I search I never win, I'm told that if you seek you shall find your ""Angel"" though I'm throwing most my hope aside, but still paraying I'll be found in time..

You don't know what you're doing to me, Baby
I know you don't care, but one day you'll see.
Today will be the day, tonight you will refrain, now that we are moving seperate ways away from we. Enough.....

Mes cours de bio... (Biology cla...,197,"tab:2213/0211/0001/0010
When I was at school,
There was a girl who sat next to me
Since she was female and I was male,
I decided to make her my fianc√©.
But, having paid no attention to my bio class,
To make myself seen, I played the idiot.
I leaned towards her and declared
The following words, a little bit as they came to me

Oh, like a coccolithophorid
Stuck between the tertiary and cretaceous
The beating of my distraught heart
Made me understand that you were my girl

She looked at me, dumbfounded. I was afraid I had said something stupid
Then her face with a dazzling smile
Revealed to me all her beautiful teeth
And when the teacher addressed immunology
She responded to me, not at all shy:

If you are a coccolithophorid
Stuck between the tertiary and the cretaceous, then I am a trilobite dead
For at least 200 million years

Apparently, she followed better than I
The few bio classes that I was there for
But while the class drew antibodies
I couldn't resign myself to forgetting her body
So putting together the few pieces of paper I had
I succeeded in replying:

Genetic polyallelism expresses itself
Through the phenotypic diversity of individuals
These few words, I ranted to tell you that you have the most beautiful eyes that I have ever seen
Looking at me, she laughed
And responded to me on a little piece of paper

Genetic polyallelism expresses itself
Through the phenotypic diversity of individuals
These few words, I know you impress them
And I expect to see you this evening after class

And walking on the stratigraphic scale
Flouting geological time
Our hypothalamus boiling
We participated in evolution!!!

When I was at school,
There was a girl who sat next to me
Since she was female and I was male,
I decided to make her my fianc√©.
But, having paid no attention to my bio class,
To make myself seen, I played the idiot.
I leaned towards her and declared
The following words, a little bit as they came to me

Oh, like a coccolithophorid
Stuck between the tertiary and cretaceous
The beating of my distraught heart
Made me understand that you were my girl

She looked at me, dumbfounded. I was afraid I had said something stupid
Then her face with a dazzling smile
Revealed to me all her beautiful teeth
And when the teacher addressed immunology
She responded to me, not at all shy:

If you are a coccolithophorid
Stuck between the tertiary and the cretaceous, then I am a trilobite dead
For at least 200 million years

Apparently, she followed better than I
The few bio classes that I was there for
But while the class drew antibodies
I couldn't resign myself to forgetting her body
So putting together the few pieces of paper I had
I succeeded in replying:

Genetic polyallelism expresses itself
Through the phenotypic diversity of individuals
These few words, I ranted to tell you that you have the most beautiful eyes that I have ever seen
Looking at me, she laughed
And responded to me on a little piece of paper

Genetic polyallelism expresses itself
Through the phenotypic diversity of individuals
These few words, I know you impress them
And I expect to see you this evening after class

And walking on the stratigraphic scale
Flouting geological time
Our hypothalamus boiling

Mais n'ayant rien suivi de mes cours de bio

Je me suis pench√© vers elle et j'ai d√©clar√©

Elle m'a regard√© d'un air √©bahi, j'ai eu peur d'avoir dit une connerie.

me d√©voila toutes ses belles dents.

c'est sur un ton d'antig√®ne, qu'elle me r√©pondit:

Lyrics:
Tell me am I ever gonna find my Angel This life.
I've got him on my mind again and though I search I never win. I'm told that if you seek you shall find your Angel though I'm, I'm throwing most of my hope aside, but still praying I'll be found in time...

Extra, Extra this just in, I've been living a lie from the beginning. I told myself No no one else, now I can't help I'm laughing at this life that I am living. Tell me will the sun come out to play, I""m tired of living in this rain of Grey, with you stealing my Umbrella, ella ella Eh Eh Eh.
It's been years, still I""m here wishing waiting wanting more, What he said he would give me.
Now the nights turned today carved in words, Displayed, Framed ""I vow to you I""m ready"". If you could take this pain away, My tears are streaming oceans on my face, No more dreaming yesterday is yerterday. YEAH YEAH YEAH... 

Tell me am I ever gonna find my Angel This life.
I've got him on my mind again and though I search I never win. I'm told that if you seek you shall find your Angel though I'm, I'm throwing most of my hope aside, but still praying I'll be found in time...

Any other day, any other time and place, you'd still be on my mind, but now I'm letting go, won't be taking this no more, I'd just be wasting my time.
Yeah you tried to show me you love me, you need me though you just deceived me and now I'm tired of waiting aimless in your arms.
Time goes by slowly, love dies, inside my soul cries, i'm holding on by breathing. I know my heart fought but it's not caught the one that it ought, Ought,. I'm letting go, I'm leaving.
If you could take alll my pain away, My tears are streaming oceans on my face, No more dreaming yesterday is yesterday. Yeah Yeah Yeah

Tell me am I ever gonna find my ""Angel"" this life, I've got him on my mind again and, and though I search I never win, I'm told that if you seek you shall find your ""Angel"" though I'm throwing most my hope aside, but still paraying I'll be found in time..

You don't know what you're doing to me, Baby
I know you don't care, but one day you'll see.
Today will be the day, tonight you will refrain, now that we are moving seperate ways away from we. Enough.....
Tell me am I ever gonna find my Angel This life.

Ezekiel's Story,391,"The Taylors shared their baby story, now go tell yours by visiting www.marchofdimes.com/everybaby

Following the premature birth of his son Zeek, Corey Taylor spent frightening days watching both his wife and their tiny baby fight for their lives. Betty had developed complications 26 weeks into her pregnancy. In danger of heart failure and coma, she had an emergency c-section. Zeek was born weighing just 1 pound 14 ounces and spent the first 103 days of his life in  neonatal intenstive care. He was given surfactant therapy to help his immature lungs inflate and went on to fight (and win) countless medical battles. Today, Zeek is an artistic 8 year old who loves music, cooking, making greeting cards, and performing with a drum line. As the 2007 National Ambassador, Zeek and his family will travel the country to share their story, raising awareness of the seriousness of premature birth.",103422,MarchofDimes,glse_zAiYAE,,,4.5,,,1191341237000,"Tue, 02 Oct 2007 16:07:17 GMT",20071002160717,People & Blogs,,

When I was at school,
There was a girl who sat next to me
Since she was female and I was male,
I decided to make her my fianc√©.
But, having paid no attention to my bio class,
To make myself seen, I played the idiot.
I leaned towards her and declared
The following words, a little bit as they came to me

Oh, like a coccolithophorid
Stuck between the tertiary and cretaceous
The beating of my distraught heart
Made me understand that you were my girl

She looked at me, dumbfounded. I was afraid I had said something stupid
Then her face with a dazzling smile
Revealed to me all her beautiful teeth
And when the teacher addressed immunology
She responded to me, not at all shy:

If you are a coccolithophorid
Stuck between the tertiary and the cretaceous, then I am a trilobite dead
For at least 200 million years

Apparently, she followed better than I
The few bio classes that I was there for
But while the class drew antibodies
I couldn't resign myself to forgetting her body
So putting together the few pieces of paper I had
I succeeded in replying:

Genetic polyallelism expresses itself
Through the phenotypic diversity of individuals
These few words, I ranted to tell you that you have the most beautiful eyes that I have ever seen
Looking at me, she laughed
And responded to me on a little piece of paper

These few words, I know you impress them
And I expect to see you this evening after class

Lyrics:
Tell me am I ever gonna find my Angel This life.
I've got him on my mind again and though I search I never win. I'm told that if you seek you shall find your Angel though I'm, I'm throwing most of my hope aside, but still praying I'll be found in time...

Extra, Extra this just in, I've been living a lie from the beginning. I told myself No no one else, now I can't help I'm laughing at this life that I am living. Tell me will the sun come out to play, I""m tired of living in this rain of Grey, with you stealing my Umbrella, ella ella Eh Eh Eh.
It's been years, still I""m here wishing waiting wanting more, What he said he would give me.
Now the nights turned today carved in words, Displayed, Framed ""I vow to you I""m ready"". If you could take this pain away, My tears are streaming oceans on my face, No more dreaming yesterday is yerterday. YEAH YEAH YEAH... 

Tell me am I ever gonna find my Angel This life.
I've got him on my mind again and though I search I never win. I'm told that if you seek you shall find your Angel though I'm, I'm throwing most of my hope aside, but still praying I'll be found in time...

Any other day, any other time and place, you'd still be on my mind, but now I'm letting go, won't be taking this no more, I'd just be wasting my time.
Yeah you tried to show me you love me, you need me though you just deceived me and now I'm tired of waiting aimless in your arms.
Time goes by slowly, love dies, inside my soul cries, i'm holding on by breathing. I know my heart fought but it's not caught the one that it ought, Ought,. I'm letting go, I'm leaving.
If you could take alll my pain away, My tears are streaming oceans on my face, No more dreaming yesterday is yesterday. Yeah Yeah Yeah

Tell me am I ever gonna find my ""Angel"" this life, I've got him on my mind again and, and though I search I never win, I'm told that if you seek you shall find your ""Angel"" though I'm throwing most my hope aside, but still paraying I'll be found in time..

You don't know what you're doing to me, Baby
I know you don't care, but one day you'll see.
Today will be the day, tonight you will refrain, now that we are moving seperate ways away from we. Enough.....
Tell me am I ever gonna find my Angel This life.
I've got him on my mind again and though I search I never win. I'm told that if you seek you shall find your Angel though I'm, I'm throwing most of my hope aside, but still praying I'll be found in time...   ;)

Mes cours de bio... (Biology cla...,197,"tab:2213/0211/0001/0010
When I was at school,
There was a girl who sat next to me
Since she was female and I was male,
I decided to make her my fianc√©.
But, having paid no attention to my bio class,
To make myself seen, I played the idiot.
I leaned towards her and declared
The following words, a little bit as they came to me

Oh, like a coccolithophorid
Stuck between the tertiary and cretaceous
The beating of my distraught heart
Made me understand that you were my girl

She looked at me, dumbfounded. I was afraid I had said something stupid
Then her face with a dazzling smile
Revealed to me all her beautiful teeth
And when the teacher addressed immunology
She responded to me, not at all shy:

If you are a coccolithophorid
Stuck between the tertiary and the cretaceous, then I am a trilobite dead
For at least 200 million years

Apparently, she followed better than I
The few bio classes that I was there for
But while the class drew antibodies
I couldn't resign myself to forgetting her body
So putting together the few pieces of paper I had
I succeeded in replying:

Genetic polyallelism expresses itself
Through the phenotypic diversity of individuals
These few words, I ranted to tell you that you have the most beautiful eyes that I have ever seen
Looking at me, she laughed
And responded to me on a little piece of paper

Genetic polyallelism expresses itself
Through the phenotypic diversity of individuals
These few words, I know you impress them
And I expect to see you this evening after class

And walking on the stratigraphic scale
Flouting geological time
Our hypothalamus boiling
We participated in evolution!!!

me d√©voila toutes ses belles dents.

Lyrics:
Tell me am I ever gonna find my Angel This life.
I've got him on my mind again and though I search I never win. I'm told that if you seek you shall find your Angel though I'm, I'm throwing most of my hope aside, but still praying I'll be found in time...

Extra, Extra this just in, I've been living a lie from the beginning. I told myself No no one else, now I can't help I'm laughing at this life that I am living. Tell me will the sun come out to play, I""m tired of living in this rain of Grey, with you stealing my Umbrella, ella ella Eh Eh Eh.
It's been years, still I""m here wishing waiting wanting more, What he said he would give me.
Now the nights turned today carved in words, Displayed, Framed ""I vow to you I""m ready"". If you could take this pain away, My tears are streaming oceans on my face, No more dreaming yesterday is yerterday. YEAH YEAH YEAH... 

Tell me am I ever gonna find my Angel This life.
I've got him on my mind again and though I search I never win. I'm told that if you seek you shall find your Angel though I'm, I'm throwing most of my hope aside, but still praying I'll be found in time...

Any other day, any other time and place, you'd still be on my mind, but now I'm letting go, won't be taking this no more, I'd just be wasting my time.
Yeah you tried to show me you love me, you need me though you just deceived me and now I'm tired of waiting aimless in your arms.
Time goes by slowly, love dies, inside my soul cries, i'm holding on by breathing. I know my heart fought but it's not caught the one that it ought, Ought,. I'm letting go, I'm leaving.
If you could take alll my pain away, My tears are streaming oceans on my face, No more dreaming yesterday is yesterday. Yeah Yeah Yeah

Tell me am I ever gonna find my ""Angel"" this life, I've got him on my mind again and, and though I search I never win, I'm told that if you seek you shall find your ""Angel"" though I'm throwing most my hope aside, but still paraying I'll be found in time..

You don't know what you're doing to me, Baby
I know you don't care, but one day you'll see.
Today will be the day, tonight you will refrain, now that we are moving seperate ways away from we. Enough.....
Tell me am I ever gonna find my Angel This life.
I've got him on my mind again and though I search I never win. I'm told that if you seek you shall find your Angel though I'm, I'm throwing most of my hope aside, but still praying I'll be found in time...   ;)

Mes cours de bio... (Biology cla...,197,"tab:2213/0211/0001/0010
When I was at school,
There was a girl who sat next to me
Since she was female and I was male,
I decided to make her my fianc√©.
But, having paid no attention to my bio class,
To make myself seen, I played the idiot.
I leaned towards her and declared
The following words, a little bit as they came to me

Oh, like a coccolithophorid
Stuck between the tertiary and cretaceous
The beating of my distraught heart
Made me understand that you were my girl

She looked at me, dumbfounded. I was afraid I had said something stupid
Then her face with a dazzling smile
Revealed to me all her beautiful teeth
And when the teacher addressed immunology
She responded to me, not at all shy:

If you are a coccolithophorid
Stuck between the tertiary and the cretaceous, then I am a trilobite dead
For at least 200 million years

Apparently, she followed better than I
The few bio classes that I was there for
But while the class drew antibodies
I couldn't resign myself to forgetting her body
So putting together the few pieces of paper I had
I succeeded in replying:

Genetic polyallelism expresses itself
Through the phenotypic diversity of individuals
These few words, I ranted to tell you that you have the most beautiful eyes that I have ever seen
Looking at me, she laughed
And responded to me on a little piece of paper

Genetic polyallelism expresses itself
Through the phenotypic diversity of individuals
These few words, I know you impress them
And I expect to see you this evening after class

And walking on the stratigraphic scale
Flouting geological time
Our hypothalamus boiling
We participated in evolution!!!

Pendant mes cours d' SVT en terminale
il y avait une fille assise √† mes c√¥t√©s
comme elle √©tait femelle et que j'√©tais un m√¢le,
j'ai d√©cid√© d'en faire ma fianc√©e.
Mais n'ayant rien suivi de mes cours de bio
Pour me faire remarquer j'ai fait l'idiot:
Je me suis pench√© vers elle et j'ai d√©clar√©
les mots suivants, un peu comme ils venaient:

Oh,tel un coccolitophorid√©
coinc√© entre le tertiaire et le cr√©tac√©
les systoles de mon coeur affol√©
m'ont fait comprendre que tu es ma dulcin√©e.

Elle m'a regard√© d'un air √©bahi, j'ai eu peur d'avoir dit une connerie.
Puis son visage d'un sourire √©clatant,
me d√©voila toutes ses belles dents.
Et quand l' prof aborda l'immunologie,
c'est sur un ton d'antig√®ne, qu'elle me r√©pondit:

Si toi tu es un coccolitophorid√©
coinc√© entre le tertiaire et le cr√©tac√©, moi je suis un trilobite d√©c√©d√©
depuis au moins 200 millions d'ann√©es.

De toute √©vidence elle suivait mieux que moi
le peu de cours de bio auxquels j'√©tais l√†
Mais pendant qu'la classe dessinait les anticorps
je n'pouvais me r√©signer √† oublier son corps,
alors r√©unissant mes quelques feuilles de SVT
je suis parvenu lui r√©torquer:

le polyall√©lisme d'un g√®ne s'exprime

ces quelques mots,je les d√©cl√¢me pour te dire que tu as les plus beaux yeux qu'j'ai jamais vu

Me regardant, elle a rigol√©,
et m'a r√©pondu sur un p'tit bout d'papier:

Instead of a dark vision of the apocalypse as seen through the eyes of mechanical horses, it's peopled with puppets from the Canadian television show Nanalan, which apparently crams everything fun you can imagine into four minutes: cute little pigtailed girls, flying rubber duckies, green backyards, grandmas and granddads playing banjos and ukuleles, cavorting canines chomping on steaks, carnival barkers, weightlifters, jugglers, and sock-puppet foot races-- all craftily rendered in the fuzziest of fabrics and the most primary of colors.

Mes cours de bio... (Biology cla...,197,"tab:2213/0211/0001/0010
When I was at school,
There was a girl who sat next to me
Since she was female and I was male,
I decided to make her my fianc√©.
But, having paid no attention to my bio class,
To make myself seen, I played the idiot.
I leaned towards her and declared
The following words, a little bit as they came to me

Oh, like a coccolithophorid
Stuck between the tertiary and cretaceous
The beating of my distraught heart
Made me understand that you were my girl

She looked at me, dumbfounded. I was afraid I had said something stupid
Then her face with a dazzling smile
Revealed to me all her beautiful teeth
And when the teacher addressed immunology
She responded to me, not at all shy:

If you are a coccolithophorid
Stuck between the tertiary and the cretaceous, then I am a trilobite dead
For at least 200 million years

Apparently, she followed better than I
The few bio classes that I was there for
But while the class drew antibodies
I couldn't resign myself to forgetting her body
So putting together the few pieces of paper I had
I succeeded in replying:

Genetic polyallelism expresses itself
Through the phenotypic diversity of individuals
These few words, I ranted to tell you that you have the most beautiful eyes that I have ever seen
Looking at me, she laughed
And responded to me on a little piece of paper

Genetic polyallelism expresses itself
Through the phenotypic diversity of individuals
These few words, I know you impress them
And I expect to see you this evening after class

And walking on the stratigraphic scale
Flouting geological time
Our hypothalamus boiling
We participated in evolution!!!

Pendant mes cours d' SVT en terminale
il y avait une fille assise √† mes c√¥t√©s
comme elle √©tait femelle et que j'√©tais un m√¢le,
j'ai d√©cid√© d'en faire ma fianc√©e.
Mais n'ayant rien suivi de mes cours de bio
Pour me faire remarquer j'ai fait l'idiot:
Je me suis pench√© vers elle et j'ai d√©clar√©
les mots suivants, un peu comme ils venaient:

Oh,tel un coccolitophorid√©
coinc√© entre le tertiaire et le cr√©tac√©
les systoles de mon coeur affol√©
m'ont fait comprendre que tu es ma dulcin√©e.

Elle m'a regard√© d'un air √©bahi, j'ai eu peur d'avoir dit une connerie.
Puis son visage d'un sourire √©clatant,
me d√©voila toutes ses belles dents.
Et quand l' prof aborda l'immunologie,
c'est sur un ton d'antig√®ne, qu'elle me r√©pondit:

Si toi tu es un coccolitophorid√©
coinc√© entre le tertiaire et le cr√©tac√©, moi je suis un trilobite d√©c√©d√©
depuis au moins 200 millions d'ann√©es.

De toute √©vidence elle suivait mieux que moi
le peu de cours de bio auxquels j'√©tais l√†
Mais pendant qu'la classe dessinait les anticorps
je n'pouvais me r√©signer √† oublier son corps,
alors r√©unissant mes quelques feuilles de SVT
je suis parvenu lui r√©torquer:

le polyall√©lisme d'un g√®ne s'exprime
par la diversit√© ph√©notypique des individus,
ces quelques mots,je les d√©cl√¢me pour te dire que tu as les plus beaux yeux qu'j'ai jamais vu

Me regardant, elle a rigol√©,
et m'a r√©pondu sur un p'tit bout d'papier:

le polyall√©lisme d'un g√®ne s'exprime
par la diversit√© ph√©notypique des individus,
ces quelques mots, je sais qu'tu les imprimes

In asking people at SouthTube whether YouTube is a community, people provided answers that I found very interesting. If you watch closely you will see many different definitions in words and images.

What Defines a Community?,371,"I am an anthropologist conducting research on video sharing on YouTube and in the video blogging community.

See: http://digitalyouth.ischool.be rkeley.edu/

Many people still argue about what a community is, and whether online groups can be communities.  In asking people at SouthTube whether YouTube is a community, people provided answers that I found very interesting. If you watch closely you will see many different definitions in words and images. What do you think defines a community? Which criteria do you find most persuasive?

Please note that this is a research site and that comments posted to the site may be used in research. For more information about the study and how posted comments are used in research please see:

""Consistently""

Written, produced and performed by
Omar K. Mills - (c)2007


Verse 1:
You are Lord of Lords; You are King of Kings.
Master of everything.
You are El-Shaddai; You are God Most High
Alpha, Omega
God Almighty You are indeed.
When I sing, I see it clearly.
But when the lights fade...
My song changes...
And my walk it dissipates...

Hook:
Oh Lord, help me, live my, my life (Consistently) (*repeats)

Verse 2:
You are The Door; You are Prince of Peace.
Walking right is just the least-
That I can do, help me do it right for You.
Lord you know my heart is true.
I don't want perfection - that I can't achieve.
Consistency I do believe-
I can attain, as long as with You I remain...
I don't want to be the same...

Omar K. Mills - (c)2007


Verse 1:
You are Lord of Lords; You are King of Kings.
Master of everything.
You are El-Shaddai; You are God Most High
Alpha, Omega
God Almighty You are indeed.
When I sing, I see it clearly.
But when the lights fade...
My song changes...
And my walk it dissipates...

Hook:
Oh Lord, help me, live my, my life (Consistently) (*repeats)

Verse 2:
You are The Door; You are Prince of Peace.
Walking right is just the least-
That I can do, help me do it right for You.
Lord you know my heart is true.
I don't want perfection - that I can't achieve.
Consistency I do believe-
I can attain, as long as with You I remain...
I don't want to be the same...

Verse 1:
You are Lord of Lords; You are King of Kings.
Master of everything.
You are El-Shaddai; You are God Most High
Alpha, Omega
God Almighty You are indeed.
When I sing, I see it clearly.
But when the lights fade...
My song changes...
And my walk it dissipates...

Hook:
Oh Lord, help me, live my, my life (Consistently) (*repeats)

Verse 2:
You are The Door; You are Prince of Peace.
Walking right is just the least-
That I can do, help me do it right for You.
Lord you know my heart is true.
I don't want perfection - that I can't achieve.
Consistency I do believe-
I can attain, as long as with You I remain...
I don't want to be the same...

Here's a song I wrote.  It's called ""Thank You For Leaving Me (When I Was Down)""  I know it's a long title, so if you have any other ideas, let me know.

Thanks so much for watching.

Here are the lyrics:

I know it wasn't easy for you babe
Loving somebody so blue
I know I wasn't ready for you, babe
But what was I supposed to do?
I thought I'd be taming these demons
With you right by my side
I thought I'd escape this self hatred
If you'd just be my guide
Lord knows I tried

Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Now I can pick myself up off the ground
Now I can cry without you around
Thank you for leaving me when I was down

I wish I could've known you better
I wish we'd written that song
I wish we could've grown old together
My list of regrets goes on and on
You say it was what it was and I
Nod and scratch my chin
Can't shake these collisions of visions of
What might have been
Making my head spin

Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Now I can pick myself up off the ground
Now I can cry without you around
Thank you for leaving me when I was down

Babe, can you hear me?
'Cause I'm singing at the top of my lungs
Babe, listen clearly
I know you still love me and I know you're the one
Babe, though I love you dearly
And it's been so long since I've seen the sun, the sun
Babe, don't you come near me
'Cause I might not have the strength
I'm not gonna have the strength to run

Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Now I can pick myself up off the ground
Now I can cry without you around
Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Now I know what your love was all about
Now you can fly without me around
Thank you for leaving me when I was down

""Consistently""

Written, produced and performed by
Omar K. Mills - (c)2007


Verse 1:
You are Lord of Lords; You are King of Kings.
Master of everything.
You are El-Shaddai; You are God Most High
Alpha, Omega
God Almighty You are indeed.
When I sing, I see it clearly.
But when the lights fade...
My song changes...
And my walk it dissipates...

Hook:
Oh Lord, help me, live my, my life (Consistently) (*repeats)

Verse 2:
You are The Door; You are Prince of Peace.
Walking right is just the least-
That I can do, help me do it right for You.
Lord you know my heart is true.
I don't want perfection - that I can't achieve.
Consistency I do believe-
I can attain, as long as with You I remain...
I don't want to be the same...

Here's a song I wrote.  It's called ""Thank You For Leaving Me (When I Was Down)""  I know it's a long title, so if you have any other ideas, let me know.

Thanks so much for watching.

Here are the lyrics:

I know it wasn't easy for you babe
Loving somebody so blue
I know I wasn't ready for you, babe
But what was I supposed to do?
I thought I'd be taming these demons
With you right by my side
I thought I'd escape this self hatred
If you'd just be my guide
Lord knows I tried

Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Now I can pick myself up off the ground
Now I can cry without you around
Thank you for leaving me when I was down

I wish I could've known you better
I wish we'd written that song
I wish we could've grown old together
My list of regrets goes on and on
You say it was what it was and I
Nod and scratch my chin
Can't shake these collisions of visions of
What might have been
Making my head spin

Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Now I can pick myself up off the ground
Now I can cry without you around
Thank you for leaving me when I was down

Babe, can you hear me?
'Cause I'm singing at the top of my lungs
Babe, listen clearly
I know you still love me and I know you're the one
Babe, though I love you dearly
And it's been so long since I've seen the sun, the sun
Babe, don't you come near me
'Cause I might not have the strength
I'm not gonna have the strength to run

Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Now I can pick myself up off the ground
Now I can cry without you around
Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Now I know what your love was all about
Now you can fly without me around
Thank you for leaving me when I was down

Thank You For Leaving Me - Origi...,224,"Download it here:

Chords are here:
http://www.mediafire.com/?atjz njncmm1

Here's a song I wrote.  It's called ""Thank You For Leaving Me (When I Was Down)""  I know it's a long title, so if you have any other ideas, let me know.

Thanks so much for watching.

Here are the lyrics:

I know it wasn't easy for you babe
Loving somebody so blue
I know I wasn't ready for you, babe
But what was I supposed to do?
I thought I'd be taming these demons
With you right by my side
I thought I'd escape this self hatred
If you'd just be my guide
Lord knows I tried

Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Now I can pick myself up off the ground
Now I can cry without you around
Thank you for leaving me when I was down

I wish I could've known you better
I wish we'd written that song
I wish we could've grown old together
My list of regrets goes on and on
You say it was what it was and I
Nod and scratch my chin
Can't shake these collisions of visions of
What might have been
Making my head spin

Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Now I can pick myself up off the ground
Now I can cry without you around
Thank you for leaving me when I was down

Babe, can you hear me?
'Cause I'm singing at the top of my lungs
Babe, listen clearly
I know you still love me and I know you're the one
Babe, though I love you dearly
And it's been so long since I've seen the sun, the sun
Babe, don't you come near me
'Cause I might not have the strength
I'm not gonna have the strength to run

Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Now I can pick myself up off the ground
Now I can cry without you around
Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Thank you for leaving me when I was down
Now I know what your love was all about
Now you can fly without me around
Thank you for leaving me when I was down

WITCH FIRE SAN DIEGO,194,"***UPDATE*** 10-24-07
Residents of our community were allowed to return to their homes today. Thankfully most of us here in 4s have been spared! 

In the video, you see the fire go right up to the wall of the firestation..and it stopped there. All the homes off Four Gee Road were untouched.

I will post a video update sometime tomorrow of our neighborhood. Check back soon... 

http://cbs8.com
http://sandiego.gov
============================== =====

This is filmed at my home in 4s Ranch, a suburb of Rancho Bernardo.

All 36,000 residents of Ramona have been ordered to evacuate because of a wind-driven brush fire.
So far it has burned at least 5,000 acres.
Evacuees ae being asked to go to Mira Mesa High School, 10510 Reagan Road or Escondido High School, 1535 N. Broadway, according to the American Red Cross. 
The shelter at Poway High School has been closed.
Highway 78 in the area of the fire was closed, as was Old Julian Highway between Ramona and Santa Ysabel.
Highway 79, north of the reservation, was also closed and traffic was 
being re-routed to Highway 76.
The Witch fire is one of two in San Diego County and seven in Southern California, prompting Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to declare a state of emergency for San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. 
Another wind-fueled brush fire in rural southern San Diego County that has grown to 14,000 acres killed one person today and injured 17 others, including four firefighters hospitalized in serious condition.

This footage is in front of my home. You will see a firestation right across the street as well as a field to the right of it. The fire completely takes over the field and starts towards the firestation.

WITCH FIRE SAN DIEGO,194,"***UPDATE*** 10-24-07
Residents of our community were allowed to return to their homes today. Thankfully most of us here in 4s have been spared! 

In the video, you see the fire go right up to the wall of the firestation..and it stopped there. All the homes off Four Gee Road were untouched.

I will post a video update sometime tomorrow of our neighborhood. Check back soon...

============================== =====

This is filmed at my home in 4s Ranch, a suburb of Rancho Bernardo.

All 36,000 residents of Ramona have been ordered to evacuate because of a wind-driven brush fire.
So far it has burned at least 5,000 acres.
Evacuees ae being asked to go to Mira Mesa High School, 10510 Reagan Road or Escondido High School, 1535 N. Broadway, according to the American Red Cross. 
The shelter at Poway High School has been closed.
Highway 78 in the area of the fire was closed, as was Old Julian Highway between Ramona and Santa Ysabel.
Highway 79, north of the reservation, was also closed and traffic was 
being re-routed to Highway 76.
The Witch fire is one of two in San Diego County and seven in Southern California, prompting Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to declare a state of emergency for San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. 
Another wind-fueled brush fire in rural southern San Diego County that has grown to 14,000 acres killed one person today and injured 17 others, including four firefighters hospitalized in serious condition.

This footage is in front of my home. You will see a firestation right across the street as well as a field to the right of it. The fire completely takes over the field and starts towards the firestation.

============================== =====

This is filmed at my home in 4s Ranch, a suburb of Rancho Bernardo.

All 36,000 residents of Ramona have been ordered to evacuate because of a wind-driven brush fire.
So far it has burned at least 5,000 acres.
Evacuees ae being asked to go to Mira Mesa High School, 10510 Reagan Road or Escondido High School, 1535 N. Broadway, according to the American Red Cross. 
The shelter at Poway High School has been closed.
Highway 78 in the area of the fire was closed, as was Old Julian Highway between Ramona and Santa Ysabel.
Highway 79, north of the reservation, was also closed and traffic was 
being re-routed to Highway 76.
The Witch fire is one of two in San Diego County and seven in Southern California, prompting Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to declare a state of emergency for San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. 
Another wind-fueled brush fire in rural southern San Diego County that has grown to 14,000 acres killed one person today and injured 17 others, including four firefighters hospitalized in serious condition.

This footage is in front of my home. You will see a firestation right across the street as well as a field to the right of it. The fire completely takes over the field and starts towards the firestation.

Michael McDonald's first music video (and Billboard chart success), ""It's Only Divine Right"", became the most influential track of the 1970s. His smooth vocal stylings, coupled with guest performances by Kenny Loggins and Christopher Cross, seemed to pave the way for 80s adult contemporary music. Also, the idea of a ""music video"" was revolutionary in its own right, and McDonald experiments with one of the earliest known instances of product placement. This song was later covered by Canadian powerpop group, The New Pornographers.
Another interesting fact: McDonald hasn't replaced the phone featured in this video since it was filmed.

Michael McDonald's first music video (and Billboard chart success), ""It's Only Divine Right"", became the most influential track of the 1970s. His smooth vocal stylings, coupled with guest performances by Kenny Loggins and Christopher Cross, seemed to pave the way for 80s adult contemporary music. Also, the idea of a ""music video"" was revolutionary in its own right, and McDonald experiments with one of the earliest known instances of product placement. This song was later covered by Canadian powerpop group, The New Pornographers.
Another interesting fact: McDonald hasn't replaced the phone featured in this video since it was filmed.

WITCH FIRE SAN DIEGO,194,"***UPDATE*** 10-24-07
Residents of our community were allowed to return to their homes today. Thankfully most of us here in 4s have been spared! 

In the video, you see the fire go right up to the wall of the firestation..and it stopped there. All the homes off Four Gee Road were untouched.

I will post a video update sometime tomorrow of our neighborhood. Check back soon...

============================== =====

This is filmed at my home in 4s Ranch, a suburb of Rancho Bernardo.

All 36,000 residents of Ramona have been ordered to evacuate because of a wind-driven brush fire.
So far it has burned at least 5,000 acres.
Evacuees ae being asked to go to Mira Mesa High School, 10510 Reagan Road or Escondido High School, 1535 N. Broadway, according to the American Red Cross. 
The shelter at Poway High School has been closed.
Highway 78 in the area of the fire was closed, as was Old Julian Highway between Ramona and Santa Ysabel.
Highway 79, north of the reservation, was also closed and traffic was 
being re-routed to Highway 76.
The Witch fire is one of two in San Diego County and seven in Southern California, prompting Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to declare a state of emergency for San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. 
Another wind-fueled brush fire in rural southern San Diego County that has grown to 14,000 acres killed one person today and injured 17 others, including four firefighters hospitalized in serious condition.

This footage is in front of my home. You will see a firestation right across the street as well as a field to the right of it. The fire completely takes over the field and starts towards the firestation.

WITCH FIRE SAN DIEGO,194,"***UPDATE*** 10-24-07
Residents of our community were allowed to return to their homes today. Thankfully most of us here in 4s have been spared! 

In the video, you see the fire go right up to the wall of the firestation..and it stopped there. All the homes off Four Gee Road were untouched.

I will post a video update sometime tomorrow of our neighborhood. Check back soon...

============================== =====

This is filmed at my home in 4s Ranch, a suburb of Rancho Bernardo.

All 36,000 residents of Ramona have been ordered to evacuate because of a wind-driven brush fire.
So far it has burned at least 5,000 acres.
Evacuees ae being asked to go to Mira Mesa High School, 10510 Reagan Road or Escondido High School, 1535 N. Broadway, according to the American Red Cross. 
The shelter at Poway High School has been closed.
Highway 78 in the area of the fire was closed, as was Old Julian Highway between Ramona and Santa Ysabel.
Highway 79, north of the reservation, was also closed and traffic was 
being re-routed to Highway 76.
The Witch fire is one of two in San Diego County and seven in Southern California, prompting Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to declare a state of emergency for San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. 
Another wind-fueled brush fire in rural southern San Diego County that has grown to 14,000 acres killed one person today and injured 17 others, including four firefighters hospitalized in serious condition.

This footage is in front of my home. You will see a firestation right across the street as well as a field to the right of it. The fire completely takes over the field and starts towards the firestation.

Michael McDonald's first music video (and Billboard chart success), ""It's Only Divine Right"", became the most influential track of the 1970s. His smooth vocal stylings, coupled with guest performances by Kenny Loggins and Christopher Cross, seemed to pave the way for 80s adult contemporary music. Also, the idea of a ""music video"" was revolutionary in its own right, and McDonald experiments with one of the earliest known instances of product placement. This song was later covered by Canadian powerpop group, The New Pornographers.
Another interesting fact: McDonald hasn't replaced the phone featured in this video since it was filmed.

I will post a video update sometime tomorrow of our neighborhood. Check back soon...

============================== =====

This is filmed at my home in 4s Ranch, a suburb of Rancho Bernardo.

All 36,000 residents of Ramona have been ordered to evacuate because of a wind-driven brush fire.
So far it has burned at least 5,000 acres.
Evacuees ae being asked to go to Mira Mesa High School, 10510 Reagan Road or Escondido High School, 1535 N. Broadway, according to the American Red Cross. 
The shelter at Poway High School has been closed.
Highway 78 in the area of the fire was closed, as was Old Julian Highway between Ramona and Santa Ysabel.
Highway 79, north of the reservation, was also closed and traffic was 
being re-routed to Highway 76.
The Witch fire is one of two in San Diego County and seven in Southern California, prompting Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to declare a state of emergency for San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. 
Another wind-fueled brush fire in rural southern San Diego County that has grown to 14,000 acres killed one person today and injured 17 others, including four firefighters hospitalized in serious condition.

This footage is in front of my home. You will see a firestation right across the street as well as a field to the right of it. The fire completely takes over the field and starts towards the firestation.

Alphacat in the Hat presents: Adult Nursery Rhymes! Sneeze While I Pee

not for the kids!

(not to be confused with ""Nursery Rhymes With Soul""!!)

Oh its horrible, oh so horrible
this thing that happens sometimes,
There's many tragedies in life, 
And this is one of mine.

See I drink lots of water,
More than 8 cups a day, 
I try not to overdo it, 
But I think water is just great.

It keeps me hydrated,
From all the 40's I drink,
Glass after glass, 
man I don't even blink.

Once I've drank enough, 
nature's quick to call, 
To the toilet! To the bathroom!
Commence the waterfall!

Down goes the zipper,
Up goes the seat!
Out comes the...light
from the light fixture above me.

I whiz and I whiz
oh boy look at me go,
If this was a rap battle
I'd have the illest flow.

But something peculiar happens,
When I'm halfway thru the deed,
That horrible, oh so horrible thing I mentioned,
Begins to happen to me.

My eyes water... my nose itches,
and I get goosebumps I think. 
And I begin to make that expression
like I'm in pain and something stinks.

I think I'm about to sneeze!
Here comes the snotty rain! 
How could I dare?!...How is it even possible, 
that I can maintain my aim?!

Ahhhh,I try to hold it
Ahhhh, this can not be!
CHOOOOOOOOO
Gah!!! I really hate it when I sneeze while I pee!!

And theres only one thing thats worse 
and this is REALLY  a bother,
when duty calls,
and I sit down, 
and my @!*$ touches the water!",525114,Alphacat,EmODpYPP5nY,,,3.5,,,1194463503000,"Wed, 07 Nov 2007 19:25:03 GMT",20071107192503,Comedy,,

Alphacat in the Hat presents: Adult Nursery Rhymes! Sneeze While I Pee

not for the kids!

(not to be confused with ""Nursery Rhymes With Soul""!!)

Oh its horrible, oh so horrible
this thing that happens sometimes,
There's many tragedies in life, 
And this is one of mine.

See I drink lots of water,
More than 8 cups a day, 
I try not to overdo it, 
But I think water is just great.

It keeps me hydrated,
From all the 40's I drink,
Glass after glass, 
man I don't even blink.

Once I've drank enough, 
nature's quick to call, 
To the toilet! To the bathroom!
Commence the waterfall!

Down goes the zipper,
Up goes the seat!
Out comes the...light
from the light fixture above me.

I whiz and I whiz
oh boy look at me go,
If this was a rap battle
I'd have the illest flow.

But something peculiar happens,
When I'm halfway thru the deed,
That horrible, oh so horrible thing I mentioned,
Begins to happen to me.

My eyes water... my nose itches,
and I get goosebumps I think. 
And I begin to make that expression
like I'm in pain and something stinks.

I think I'm about to sneeze!
Here comes the snotty rain! 
How could I dare?!...How is it even possible, 
that I can maintain my aim?!

Ahhhh,I try to hold it
Ahhhh, this can not be!
CHOOOOOOOOO
Gah!!! I really hate it when I sneeze while I pee!!

And theres only one thing thats worse 
and this is REALLY  a bother,
when duty calls,
and I sit down, 
and my @!*$ touches the water!",583902,Alphacat,EmODpYPP5nY,,,3.5,,,1194484891000,"Thu, 08 Nov 2007 01:21:31 GMT",20071108012131,Comedy,,

Lyrics:

Waitin' Tables, Waitin for the tables to turn
Waitin' Tables, Waitin in a city with no left hand turns

Where are you now?

$30, makin $30 a day
$30 but the meter maid came and took it all away

Where is the love?

Sleep's the only place where I can see your face these days

You take me home
You give me hope

Ride the clock and wait in vain
same ol difference but what's it make?
Just minimum wage

Reading fables, reading into windows of hope- and pray
prayin that the wind'll come and blow you my way

Where are ya now?

Seems the only place that I can find you's
in this song...
You give me hope
Beautiful girl
You take me home

Lyrics:

Waitin' Tables, Waitin for the tables to turn
Waitin' Tables, Waitin in a city with no left hand turns

Where are you now?

$30, makin $30 a day
$30 but the meter maid came and took it all away

Where is the love?

Sleep's the only place where I can see your face these days

You take me home
You give me hope

Ride the clock and wait in vain
same ol difference but what's it make?
Just minimum wage

Reading fables, reading into windows of hope- and pray
prayin that the wind'll come and blow you my way

Where are ya now?

Seems the only place that I can find you's
in this song...
You give me hope
Beautiful girl
You take me home

Waitin' Tables, Waitin for the tables to turn
Waitin' Tables, Waitin in a city with no left hand turns

Where are you now?

$30, makin $30 a day
$30 but the meter maid came and took it all away

Where is the love?

Sleep's the only place where I can see your face these days

You take me home
You give me hope

Ride the clock and wait in vain
same ol difference but what's it make?
Just minimum wage

Reading fables, reading into windows of hope- and pray
prayin that the wind'll come and blow you my way

Where are ya now?

Seems the only place that I can find you's
in this song...
You give me hope
Beautiful girl

GOP Debate Song (Live),87,"This is a relatively untitled song about the upcoming GOP debate on YouTube.

Also see the music video version of this video at:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v =D4f28pO17Ug

Lyrics:

The Grand Old Party's looking for
Somebody who can lead
Someone who is electable
And adheres to our creed

Some say the group is not diverse
They're white, they're men, but wait:
The Dems have just one candidate;
Republicans have eight

Rudy's leading all the polls
But can he win the base?
Mitt changed on abortion
Hist'ry he can't erase

Ron Paul would end the FDA
And that is just a start
Fred has just begun to run
But sure does look the part

Hunter tells us what to do
In foreign policy debates
Huckabee's compassionate
And lost a lot of weight

Tancredo says ""let's build a fence""
Across the whole southwest
McCain is loved by many
And hated by the rest

We don't know who we're voting for
We don't know who will win
That's why we use YouTube to ask
Our questions of these men

Time is short, we're voting soon
And I just thought I'd mention
If we don't reach consensus, then
We'll decide at convention

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v =D4f28pO17Ug

Lyrics:

The Grand Old Party's looking for
Somebody who can lead
Someone who is electable
And adheres to our creed

Some say the group is not diverse
They're white, they're men, but wait:
The Dems have just one candidate;
Republicans have eight

Rudy's leading all the polls
But can he win the base?
Mitt changed on abortion
Hist'ry he can't erase

Ron Paul would end the FDA
And that is just a start
Fred has just begun to run
But sure does look the part

Hunter tells us what to do
In foreign policy debates
Huckabee's compassionate
And lost a lot of weight

Tancredo says ""let's build a fence""
Across the whole southwest
McCain is loved by many
And hated by the rest

We don't know who we're voting for
We don't know who will win
That's why we use YouTube to ask
Our questions of these men

Time is short, we're voting soon
And I just thought I'd mention

We'll decide at convention

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v =D4f28pO17Ug

Lyrics:

The Grand Old Party's looking for
Somebody who can lead
Someone who is electable
And adheres to our creed

Some say the group is not diverse
They're white, they're men, but wait:
The Dems have just one candidate;
Republicans have eight

Rudy's leading all the polls
But can he win the base?
Mitt changed on abortion
Hist'ry he can't erase

Ron Paul would end the FDA
And that is just a start
Fred has just begun to run
But sure does look the part

Hunter tells us what to do
In foreign policy debates
Huckabee's compassionate
And lost a lot of weight

Tancredo says ""let's build a fence""
Across the whole southwest
McCain is loved by many
And hated by the rest

We don't know who we're voting for
We don't know who will win
That's why we use YouTube to ask
Our questions of these men

Time is short, we're voting soon
And I just thought I'd mention
If we don't reach consensus, then
We'll decide at convention

Mashed Potato Wrestling -Barnesv...,114,"Potato Days: Barnesville

Ah, the feeling of potatoes in your trousers. What else do you need? If you like weird America, this is your kind of action. It's got a potato sack fashion show, tons of potato related foods and mashed potato wrestling. In fact, it's where my alter ego, Steve-O Gratin, became the undisputed Mashed Potato Wrestling Champion of the Universe. They fill a pit with taters that's like 20' x 10' big and more than a 1' deep. Contestants sign up to wrestle their friends for three 2-minute rounds and inject their own ringside drama. A ref gets in the mix and there's a blow by blow account over a P.A. system. It's totally ridiculous. Despite it being insanely hard and exhausting to move in the stuff, its hands down the most fun you can have dressed in a unitard or watching something in a lawn chair. I'm returning next year to defend my title so watch out! Get hosed off by the local fire department and head over to the demolition derby for some good old perfectly legal road rage in the mud. Whoo.

we are concerned too. but not doing this project does change nothing. it doesn't make the world a better place.
if you are really concerned about the distribution of wealth then do something about it! read books about the real cause of hunger. talk with your friends and family about it. change your own life and try to change politics. buy and support the right things. it is not people using vegetables differently than usual that make the world a bad place. it's all of us wanting too much. our own car, a new cellphone, a bigger house with air condition, more money...

LYRICS
I'm on my way.
Got six dollars in my pocket
Don't where I'm headed but,
I wanna make like a rocket and go,
So no one can catch me.
I'm on my mark, lets go, i'm ready.
Please listen baby, I need this baby,
come with me baby, lets go.

CHORUS
Push the pedal to the floor, I'm out of here.
Can't take it anymore, i need you here.
I can't make up my mind, i run with fear.
Don't wanna leave you behind, so I'll make like a rocket and go.

Departure time.
I ain't looking back, i'm out to shine.
Just gotta get to you girl.
Want you to know I'm for sure, i'm ready.
My mind is set.
No one can change the way I feel about the future.
Please listen baby, 
You need me baby, i'm ready baby, 
lets go.

CHORUS
Push the pedal to the floor, I'm out of here.

Can't take it anymore, i need you here.
I can't make up my mind, i run with fear.
Don't wanna leave you behind, so I'll make like a rocket and go.

I ain't looking back, i'm out to shine.
Just gotta get to you girl.

I could fly to Japan
Could go to South America

Could run like hell to China
I could go to Egypt
Could run like a late rabbit and I wouldn't move one bit

I'm stuck here in the darkness
Blinded by all the light
Standing outside my body with my body still in sight

I could travel the whole world
I could just stand up still
And that's, I know, an image that would make some people ill

Someday somebody said to me
I think it was a man
""As long as you're okay with it""
And that I think I am.

wow, were are really amazed about the flood of comments in the last hours. so thank you all for your kind and unkind comments. we really appreciated that! sorry that we can not answer all... it's just too much!

just one word to all the people who are concerned about people dying of starvation:
we are concerned too. but not doing this project does change nothing. it doesn't make the world a better place.
if you are really concerned about the distribution of wealth then do something about it! read books about the real cause of hunger. talk with your friends and family about it. change your own life and try to change politics. buy and support the right things. it is not people using vegetables differently than usual that make the world a bad place. it's all of us wanting too much. our own car, a new cellphone, a bigger house with air condition, more money...
sending the vegetables to africa does not help. on the contrary it destroys the markets there, so people can not sell their own produce, because the imported one is too cheap. 

and by the way: people have used vegetables for music for centuries. also in africa.

Australia

I could go to Australia
I could fly to Japan
Could go to South America
Well, everybody can

Could run like hell to China
I could go to Egypt
Could run like a late rabbit and I wouldn't move one bit

I'm stuck here in the darkness
Blinded by all the light
Standing outside my body with my body still in sight

I could travel the whole world
I could just stand up still
And that's, I know, an image that would make some people ill

Someday somebody said to me
I think it was a man
""As long as you're okay with it""
And that I think I am.

Lyrics:

God he turned and walked away
I couldn't think of what to say
when plane engines fall through your roof
and I broke my knee while walking down the street that I live in
While no one was passing by

Chorus:
Life moves along and it trickles down the cheeks of every beautiful boy
Time comes along and it breaks every bone in your spine

Into the flight of night 
Insomnia strikes and hopes alight
We set ourselves up to fall
So we stargaze and we write down all the things that we'll do
Fall into the river our pockets full of stones
Full of stones..

Chorus, etc.

Lyrics for 'Live Alone'

Unwilling to accept myself see your face and make it easy
Think I'll never love again holding dreams to make it easy
Trying to stop myself saying things I didn't mean
I think I can make it through if I only hold onto you

Live alone now, baby live alone
Live alone now, baby live a lie

Wish I could stop myself saying things I didn't mean
Wish I could hold your hand and tell you that i didn't dream
Wish I could love myself and tell you things to make it easy
Trying to protect myself saying things I didn't mean

Should've known now, baby live alone
Should've known now, you'd always live alone
Should've known now, things to make it easy
Trying to stop myself, taking time to let you dream

Baby live alone
Live alone now, you know I should've known
Live alone now, I thought I saw you cry
Live alone now, you know you live a lie",19825,Isaacthompson,kWNZyMpiY6w,,,4.5,,,1197486416000,"Wed, 12 Dec 2007 19:06:56 GMT",20071212190656,Music,kungfucolin,

Lyrics:

God he turned and walked away
I couldn't think of what to say
when plane engines fall through your roof
and I broke my knee while walking down the street that I live in
While no one was passing by

Chorus:
Life moves along and it trickles down the cheeks of every beautiful boy
Time comes along and it breaks every bone in your spine

Into the flight of night 
Insomnia strikes and hopes alight
We set ourselves up to fall
So we stargaze and we write down all the things that we'll do
Fall into the river our pockets full of stones
Full of stones..

Chorus, etc.

Lyrics for 'Live Alone'

Unwilling to accept myself see your face and make it easy
Think I'll never love again holding dreams to make it easy
Trying to stop myself saying things I didn't mean
I think I can make it through if I only hold onto you

Live alone now, baby live alone
Live alone now, baby live a lie

Wish I could stop myself saying things I didn't mean
Wish I could hold your hand and tell you that i didn't dream
Wish I could love myself and tell you things to make it easy
Trying to protect myself saying things I didn't mean

Should've known now, baby live alone
Should've known now, you'd always live alone
Should've known now, things to make it easy
Trying to stop myself, taking time to let you dream

Baby live alone
Live alone now, you know I should've known
Live alone now, I thought I saw you cry
Live alone now, you know you live a lie",35929,Isaacthompson,kWNZyMpiY6w,,,4.5,,,1197510010000,"Thu, 13 Dec 2007 01:40:10 GMT",20071213014010,Music,kungfucolin,

Hook
Ellen on this
Ellen on that 
Ellen so hot
Ellen on the map
Ellen on the stage
Ellen on the screen
America's It Girl cus Ellen so clean

Verse 1
The lady who started out doin stand up jokes
Done made it to the top with an award winning show
And she's America's hope showin ladies how to make it
Be yourself and stay true ladies you ain't gotta fake it 
Critics hate it
Ellen upgraded
All she had is one chance so you know she had to take it
Do it big on the screen with American Express
Marc Jacobs keep her fresh she don't gotta wear a dress
Her career was a struggle now everybody love her
Nowadays she's the girl on the magazine cover
America's it girl Ellen
Dance on the show now everybody yellin
Get it like Ellen DeGeneres
Rose to the top now the whole world feelin it

Verse 2
You can catch Ellen on the TV or a movie too
Lookin fly in jeans or a custom Gucci Suit
Everybody like Ellen cus she lookin cool and cute
Rose from the bottom to the top baby what it do
Don't hate when you see her groove on the show
She crunk cus she won 5 Emmy's in a row
She do it for the love it ain't all about the dough
Hollywood superstar Ellen shine and she glow
Competition is torn
Coming up short
That's why she hosted the Academy Awards
People love to talk about you when you down and you out
But they all on your team when you get a little clout
Ellen ain't gotta do what everybody else feelin
But she do her own thing and she still making millions
Ellen ain't gotta do what everybody else feelin
But she do her own thing and she still making millions",277510,BentleyGreen,e8ZRd0KJXeg,,,4.5,,,1197673789000,"Fri, 14 Dec 2007 23:09:49 GMT",20071214230949,Entertainment,kungfucolin,

This year, you get to join them.

First, submit a video answering The Davos Question:

""What one thing do you think that countries, companies or individuals must do to make the world a better place in 2008?""

Then, starting January 1st, watch and rank others' ideas. The highest-rated videos will be screened in Davos (January 23-27), where world leaders will watch your videos and make responses of their own. Your idea could be the start of something big.

To find out more about the World Economic Forum, go here:

http://www.weforum.org/en/inde x.htm

SOME TIPS:

1. Be original - choose your own idea and approach. Your video can be in the form of a vlog, documentary, skit... anything goes.

2. Back it up - explain why your perspective is important through evidence or a personal story.

3. Keep it sharp - you can choose to go short or long, but we recommend you keep your video at under 3 minutes.

4. Make it look good - speak loudly and keep that camera steady.

5. Provide context - in the video description, include your name, country, and hometown.

Hook
Ellen on this
Ellen on that 
Ellen so hot
Ellen on the map
Ellen on the stage
Ellen on the screen
America's It Girl cus Ellen so clean

Verse 1
The lady who started out doin stand up jokes
Done made it to the top with an award winning show
And she's America's hope showin ladies how to make it
Be yourself and stay true ladies you ain't gotta fake it 
Critics hate it
Ellen upgraded
All she had is one chance so you know she had to take it
Do it big on the screen with American Express
Marc Jacobs keep her fresh she don't gotta wear a dress
Her career was a struggle now everybody love her
Nowadays she's the girl on the magazine cover
America's it girl Ellen
Dance on the show now everybody yellin
Get it like Ellen DeGeneres
Rose to the top now the whole world feelin it

Verse 2
You can catch Ellen on the TV or a movie too
Lookin fly in jeans or a custom Gucci Suit
Everybody like Ellen cus she lookin cool and cute
Rose from the bottom to the top baby what it do
Don't hate when you see her groove on the show
She crunk cus she won 5 Emmy's in a row
She do it for the love it ain't all about the dough
Hollywood superstar Ellen shine and she glow
Competition is torn
Coming up short
That's why she hosted the Academy Awards
People love to talk about you when you down and you out
But they all on your team when you get a little clout
Ellen ain't gotta do what everybody else feelin
But she do her own thing and she still making millions
Ellen ain't gotta do what everybody else feelin
But she do her own thing and she still making millions",364312,BentleyGreen,e8ZRd0KJXeg,,,4.5,,,1197772534000,"Sun, 16 Dec 2007 02:35:34 GMT",20071216023534,Entertainment,,

Larkin Step (Original),200,"comments are welcome.

ps. when i said ""bad songwriters on youtube"" i was referring to myself...so if you don't get self-deprecating humour, i guess this little 'ps' won't help much either. 

just anticipating provocateurs. i mean, this IS youtube. with chain-letters version 2.48. (haha).

Thanks for all the kind comments! You want lyrics, you got them. =)

Lyrics:

God he turned and walked away
I couldn't think of what to say
when plane engines fall through your roof
and I broke my knee while walking down the street that I live in
While no one was passing by

Chorus:
Life moves along and it trickles down the cheeks of every beautiful boy
Time comes along and it breaks every bone in your spine

Into the flight of night 
Insomnia strikes and hopes alight
We set ourselves up to fall
So we stargaze and we write down all the things that we'll do
Fall into the river our pockets full of stones
Full of stones..

Chorus, etc.

Lyrics for 'Live Alone'

Unwilling to accept myself see your face and make it easy
Think I'll never love again holding dreams to make it easy
Trying to stop myself saying things I didn't mean
I think I can make it through if I only hold onto you

Live alone now, baby live alone
Live alone now, baby live a lie

Wish I could stop myself saying things I didn't mean
Wish I could hold your hand and tell you that i didn't dream
Wish I could love myself and tell you things to make it easy
Trying to protect myself saying things I didn't mean

Should've known now, baby live alone
Should've known now, you'd always live alone
Should've known now, things to make it easy
Trying to stop myself, taking time to let you dream

Baby live alone
Live alone now, you know I should've known
Live alone now, I thought I saw you cry
Live alone now, you know you live a lie",173373,Isaacthompson,kWNZyMpiY6w,,,4.5,,,1197772534000,"Sun, 16 Dec 2007 02:35:34 GMT",20071216023534,Music,,

Dear Viewers/Listeners,
I have read all of your comments/messages and i sincerely apologize for not replying to everyone sooner. As mentioned in my previous video, i have been cut off the internet for a bit and i lack the time to do so. 
Although, that doesnt change the fact that i am touched beyond words by all the lovely things everyone has left for me. 
That being said, it's the best Christmas gift i've ever received.

So thank you thank you thank you, to all subscribers, and YouTube, for the feature.

I hope everyone's had/will have a good Christmas and a blessed New Year.

PS: I will be replying to everyone as soon as i can.

------------------------------ -----------
Don't be fooled by the title, this one has a happy ending. All in the good spirit of Christmas.

I wrote this one a few weeks ago, and recorded it last night. 

This song was inspired by everything i've experienced/read/watched/heard of from movies or stories, about one's lover being far away for Christmas, be it serving in the army, college, another country, peace corps etc... In a way, it's also about not losing hope.
Although that's just my opinion, so do share yours.
The words in this one are simple and direct. I do hope everyone will enjoy it.

I stayed with the 'silent movie feel' as i think it suits the song.

It is a bit too early, but as i said, i dont know when i'll be able to post next, but if i do, it'll be another Christmas cover. So stay tuned!

=)

Merry Christmas to all of my wonderful subscribers and listeners.

No, there won't be Christmas for me this year
For the simple reason being you're not here

There won't be eggnogs by the cozy fire
There won't be glasses of mulled wine either
There won't even be a Christmas tree
'cause you're not here to light it up with me

Oh, Santa honey, won't you bring my baby back to me?
'cause i miss him, yes, i miss him oh so dearly

I haven't sent him his Christmas card
'cause that would mean we really are apart
The Christmas stockings are as empty as my heart

I know you're away doing something good
But just this once, baby, if you could
You know you can, and you know should
'cause Christmas won't be Christmas...

without you

Two days to Christmas and i'm still waiting outside
Wishing upon a star that you'll be coming home tonight
But it was cold, it was getting late
Sadly, i crept back into bed
But then i felt a soft kiss on my cheek
I opened my eyes, and there my baby was...

with me!

My baby came back for me

F
working out, losing weight 
Bb  
maybe using tanning spray
F     Bb 
becoming more attractive in general 

reading more, watching less
learning all the rules for chess
becoming somewhat smarter in general
eating fish, not fingernails
volunteer to save the whales
becoming a better guy in general
saving more, spending less
yes I will wax my chest
dating more girls in general

Bridge     C   Bb     F 
But not this year. No this year is different!
As different as a gazelle.  Yes, a gazelle from a deer.  (They're actually not that different.)
After all these failed resolutions.     Bb  C     Bb     C
My future is clear, the future is near!

Chorus:  F  A  Bb  C
Just forget those resolutions you 
know that you are never gonna do
and adopt a more realistical view 
by committing to things that come easily to you
like eat at least one value meal a week
or put the correct shoes on the correct feet
Bb     C     F
just ""Raise the bar to walk effortlessly underneath!""

Chorus2:
Just face the fact you've always thought
those resolutions don't mean squat
Settle in to a comfortable spot
embrace all the things you know you are not.
Hit the snooze, roll over, then repeat
Make large purchases, then lose the receipts
just ""Raise the bar to walk effortlessly underneath!""

Sweet Celine-by Matthew (James) ...,191,"Hello All! 
First of all, Let me give a great big THANK YOU!! for all of the kind responses to my music. I have never experienced anything like it.

I am about three thousand emails behind as of today so I dedcided to post an evil form letter (!) as a way of catching up on the most frequently asked questions. 
1. I have a new record coming out by the end of Jan. It will be ukulele and guitalele based. I will release a video of one of the songs on the album at the same time to let you know it is available. If you want, you can subscribe to my channnel to  make sure you get the video delivered to you.

2. You can download ""Sweet Celine"" and ""Born"" at matthewandrae dot wordpress dot com 

3. I will tour the record. Presently I play 250 dates per year and I am accepting votes to come to your city at matthewandrae dot com . If you want your city to be included in the tour, vote for it. 

4. I used the following equipment for the recording: FAQ: front end is a Groove Tubes "" MD1B "" direct into a m-audio box usb'ed into my laptop. the video writes on the home drive and the audio goes to an outboard drive. nobody spins faster than 7500rpm nothing fancy. Lexicon med room, damped at 10k. 3db (one octave wide) at 1,350hz. Sonitus multiband eq preset for female voice (It seems to jump off the computer better).

 My Live rig is a Neumann kms 105 to a yamaha o1v96v2 to KV2 ex12s. My guitalele is a yamaha GL1 and my guitar is a modified Taylor t5 custom.

And 5. I do not have the sheet music for Sweet Celine out yet. 
but I do have the lyric which is posted at matthewandrae dot com and matthewandrae dot wordpress dot com .

Again, Thank you for all of your support and kind words! I will endeavor to keep up with your kind questions and support via email, but I will be behind for a while.

I wish I kept braids in my hair then I'd

Hello All! 
First of all, Let me give a great big THANK YOU!! for all of the kind responses to my music. I have never experienced anything like it.

I am about three thousand emails behind as of today so I dedcided to post an evil form letter (!) as a way of catching up on the most frequently asked questions. 
1. I have a new record coming out by the end of Jan. It will be ukulele and guitalele based. I will release a video of one of the songs on the album at the same time to let you know it is available. If you want, you can subscribe to my channnel to  make sure you get the video delivered to you.

2. You can download ""Sweet Celine"" and ""Born"" at matthewandrae dot wordpress dot com 

3. I will tour the record. Presently I play 250 dates per year and I am accepting votes to come to your city at matthewandrae dot com . If you want your city to be included in the tour, vote for it. 

4. I used the following equipment for the recording: FAQ: front end is a Groove Tubes "" MD1B "" direct into a m-audio box usb'ed into my laptop. the video writes on the home drive and the audio goes to an outboard drive. nobody spins faster than 7500rpm nothing fancy. Lexicon med room, damped at 10k. 3db (one octave wide) at 1,350hz. Sonitus multiband eq preset for female voice (It seems to jump off the computer better).

 My Live rig is a Neumann kms 105 to a yamaha o1v96v2 to KV2 ex12s. My guitalele is a yamaha GL1 and my guitar is a modified Taylor t5 custom.

And 5. I do not have the sheet music for Sweet Celine out yet. 
but I do have the lyric which is posted at matthewandrae dot com and matthewandrae dot wordpress dot com .

Again, Thank you for all of your support and kind words! I will endeavor to keep up with your kind questions and support via email, but I will be behind for a while. 

You all rock like crazy!! I love you! 
Matthew Andrae

Hello All! 
First of all, Let me give a great big THANK YOU!! for all of the kind responses to my music. I have never experienced anything like it.

I am about three thousand emails behind as of today so I dedcided to post an evil form letter (!) as a way of catching up on the most frequently asked questions. 
1. I have a new record coming out by the end of Jan. It will be ukulele and guitalele based. I will release a video of one of the songs on the album at the same time to let you know it is available. If you want, you can subscribe to my channnel to make sure you get the video delivered to you.

2. You can download ""Sweet Celine"" and ""Born"" at http://www.matthewandrae.wordp ress.com 

3. I will tour the record. Presently I play 250 dates per year and I am accepting votes to come to your city at http://www.matthewandrae.com If you want your city to be included in the tour, vote for it. 

4. I used the following equipment for the recording: FAQ: front end is a Groove Tubes "" MD1B "" direct into a m-audio box usb'ed into my laptop. the video writes on the home drive and the audio goes to an outboard drive. nobody spins faster than 7500rpm nothing fancy. Lexicon med room, damped at 10k. 3db (one octave wide) at 1,350hz. Sonitus multiband eq preset for female voice (It seems to jump off the computer better).

My Live rig is a Neumann kms 105 to a yamaha o1v96v2 to KV2 ex12s. My guitalele is a yamaha GL1 and my guitar is a modified Taylor t5 custom.

And 5. I do not have the sheet music for Sweet Celine out yet. 
but I do have the lyric which is posted at http://www.matthewandrae.com and http://www.matthewandrae.wordp ress.com

Again, Thank you for all of your support and kind words! I will endeavor to keep up with your kind questions and support via email, but I will be behind for a while. 

You all rock like crazy!! I love you! 
Matthew Andrae

A peristaltic pump attached to the pedal crank draws water from a large tank, through a carbon filter, to a smaller clean tank. The clean tank is removable and closed for contamination-free home storage and use. A clutch engages and disengages the drive belt from the pedal crank, enabling the rider to filter the water while traveling or while stationary.

""For these past ten years I've been participating in the World Economic Forum in Davos. As a writer, as a human being I think that everybody in the world is commited to improve the state of the world.

			Transparency.
Collaboration.
Accountability. 
Decentralization.
Measureable results.
Quick feedback loops.
Third party reporting.
Not top down, but bottom up.

Not donations and charity but equal partnerships and grassroots collaboration.

Don't fight poverty, increase economic opportunity.

Don't fight global warming, increase environmental sustainability.

Don't fight aids, hunger and obesity increase healthy behavior.

If you're a well-off philanthropist, powerful captain of industry, or high level government official working to ""make the world a better place"" you must read the following two books: Despite Good Intentions & The Lords of Poverty

Actually, even if you're not one of the elite and simply want to make the world a better place, you should read both those books too.

Ned.com is a global all-volunteer, member-governed, online social network (in combination with real-world locations) that is made up of social entrepreneurs, activists, artists, social purpose enterprises, grassroots nonprofit, non-governmental, and community-based organizations, and is collaborating and taking action locally, nationally & globally, in order to make the world a better place.

All the media circus is buzzing on who will survive Super Tuesday. Forget what the people in the media say about your candidate. Vote only, if you feel that they have the principles and issues that you feel is necessary in a president. 

Don't let you voice not be heard. Vote, vote, vote!

It's time to go the distance, we have to speak out and saying something. We want to get the message out.

Note: Each candidate will get some commentary during the final weeks leading up to the Super Tuesday primary. I take no sides in the election. I vote on issues, not principle. Please be civil to those who don't agree with your views or your candidate. To all the friends of my videos, you should be able to post your comments without approval. Those who found my video (and not friends but subscribers), you may experience a delay.

All the media circus is buzzing on who will survive Super Tuesday. Forget what the people in the media say about your candidate. Vote only, if you feel that they have the principles and issues that you feel is necessary in a president.

Chorus
On my way to Gloryland
With my heart held in my hand
The shadows cast, the light it falls on my face
and I'm walking onto Grace
There's nothing more that I could have been
I'd given all their was left to give
Now i'm spent, yes i'm spent
But my dear, I made it into gloryland

verse
dry your eyes, dry your eyes
don't keep thinking of our last goodbyes
lift your head turn on the light
try and move on from the sleepless nights
it's been so hard, it's been so hard
for you to let go of the battle scars
fade away, fade away
see the clouds are all the same, think of me when the grey skies end cos i'm - Chorus

Verse2
If you could see, if you could see
You hold me close under a lock and key
the minutes hurt but time remains
another obstacle that's in your way
take a chance, just take a chance
Lie on the floor and make the moment last
free your mind, free your mind
see the clouds are all the same
think of me at rainbows end cos I'm - chorus

bridge
dry your eyes, dry your eyes
don't keep thinking of our last goodbyes
dry your eyes, dry your eyes
there's so much more than our last goodbyes
take a chance, take a chance, take a chance for me
fade away, fade away, fade away from me......

Star Wars according to a 3 year ...,90,"02/26/08 Update: Wow.  What was expected to be a short movie that would circulate within a small circle of friends has turned into something much more very quickly.  I'm thrilled that so many people have enjoyed this video but also somewhat mortified that I added this without my daughter's knowledge or consent.  Maybe someday she will find some humor in it.

Comments: Have been disabled.  I think they have run their course.  To those who have sent positive comments, thank you very much.  You've made us appreciate what we have even more than we already do.  To those of you who've said you've changed your mind about having children, well, have at it. :)

Business inquiries/agents: Thanks for your interest.  At the current time we have no intention of exposing our little one to the destroyer of youth that is the entertainment industry.  Hopefully if she chooses to follow this path on her own someday she will find a door still open for her.

Other things: 

She has never seen Pokemon so I don't think she's making a reference to the ball on that show.  I think she just means pokey ball as in ""a ball that is pokey.""  (And yes, I know what the pokey balls really are!  Stop emailing :) )

Three year olds can't read.  I'm sure there are exceptions to that rule. 

------------------------------ -------

From www.fistofblog.com

Here is my daughter, age 3, explaining the plot of Star Wars Episode IV.

She explained the whole movie to me in much greater detail but unfortunately I didn't have the camera going.  When I finally caught her talking about the movie again she delivered this truncated, but still funny, version.

Edit: Thank you all for the nice comments.  Maybe I will print them out for her and someday and when she's all growed up she'll get to read them herself.

A little more about the video: She wasn't coached to say anything, nor was she forced to make the video.  She rarely stops talking.  Those of you with children understand this: sometimes it's harder to turn the faucet off than to turn the faucet on.

Believe it or not, she has the seem the movie only once, and I spread it out over 3 days so it wouldn't be too much all at once for her.

The video was edited to make it shorter, more cohesive and hopefully funnier.  I did move some of the lines around so it would make more sense.

LUSAKA SUNRISE,415,"""In Africa, soccer is religion,"" commentator Dennis Liewewe declares. With millions of fans and thousands of youth aspiring to be soccer stars, soccer effortlessly catalyzes community. Using the power of soccer in the fight against AIDS, Grassroot Soccer (http://www.grassrootsoccer.or g) provides African youth with the skills and support to live HIV free.

What Makes a Great Babysitter?,134,"DadLabs Ep. 258 The Lounge - For this episode of the Lounge we asked what makes a babysitter great to our panel of expert parents, and to members of our non-studio (bar) audience as well. Is it dependability? Creativity? Experience? Cheap rate? What do you think the qualities of an outstanding babysitter are? Watch as a collective portrait of the ideal babysitter emerges from a smallish tavern in Austin. This episode brought to you by Sittercity.com.

Please come join us for the next taping of the DadLabs Lounge. We'll be at the Tiniest Bar in Texas on Thursday, February 7th from 4-7PM. One lucky Labber will win a Mutsy stroller worth over $750!

If a tree falls in a forest and no one's around...does it make a sound? Does it matter if you know it's fallen? A deaf girl lets the audience into her silent world. But  are her initial beliefs valid?

Chorus
On my way to Gloryland
With my heart held in my hand
The shadows cast, the light it falls on my face
and I'm walking onto Grace
There's nothing more that I could have been
I'd given all their was left to give
Now i'm spent, yes i'm spent
But my dear, I made it into gloryland

verse
dry your eyes, dry your eyes
don't keep thinking of our last goodbyes
lift your head turn on the light
try and move on from the sleepless nights
it's been so hard, it's been so hard
for you to let go of the battle scars
fade away, fade away
see the clouds are all the same, think of me when the grey skies end cos i'm - Chorus

Verse2
If you could see, if you could see
You hold me close under a lock and key
the minutes hurt but time remains
another obstacle that's in your way
take a chance, just take a chance
Lie on the floor and make the moment last
free your mind, free your mind
see the clouds are all the same
think of me at rainbows end cos I'm - chorus

bridge
dry your eyes, dry your eyes
don't keep thinking of our last goodbyes
dry your eyes, dry your eyes
there's so much more than our last goodbyes
take a chance, take a chance, take a chance for me
fade away, fade away, fade away from me......

Star Wars according to a 3 year ...,90,"02/26/08 Update: Wow.  What was expected to be a short movie that would circulate within a small circle of friends has turned into something much more very quickly.  I'm thrilled that so many people have enjoyed this video but also somewhat mortified that I added this without my daughter's knowledge or consent.  Maybe someday she will find some humor in it.

Comments: Have been disabled.  I think they have run their course.  To those who have sent positive comments, thank you very much.  You've made us appreciate what we have even more than we already do.  To those of you who've said you've changed your mind about having children, well, have at it. :)

Business inquiries/agents: Thanks for your interest.  At the current time we have no intention of exposing our little one to the destroyer of youth that is the entertainment industry.  Hopefully if she chooses to follow this path on her own someday she will find a door still open for her.

Other things: 

She has never seen Pokemon so I don't think she's making a reference to the ball on that show.  I think she just means pokey ball as in ""a ball that is pokey.""  (And yes, I know what the pokey balls really are!  Stop emailing :) )

Three year olds can't read.  I'm sure there are exceptions to that rule. 

------------------------------ -------

From www.fistofblog.com

Here is my daughter, age 3, explaining the plot of Star Wars Episode IV.

She explained the whole movie to me in much greater detail but unfortunately I didn't have the camera going.  When I finally caught her talking about the movie again she delivered this truncated, but still funny, version.

Edit: Thank you all for the nice comments.  Maybe I will print them out for her and someday and when she's all growed up she'll get to read them herself.

A little more about the video: She wasn't coached to say anything, nor was she forced to make the video.  She rarely stops talking.  Those of you with children understand this: sometimes it's harder to turn the faucet off than to turn the faucet on.

Believe it or not, she has the seem the movie only once, and I spread it out over 3 days so it wouldn't be too much all at once for her.

The video was edited to make it shorter, more cohesive and hopefully funnier.  I did move some of the lines around so it would make more sense.

Sigur R√≥s 'Heima',5841,"we are happy to present the full film 'heima' on YouTube. to get a free download of an unreleased clip from 'heima', go to http://www.sigurros.com

'heima' is sigur r√≥s's first ever film, filmed over two weeks during the summer of 2006 when the band undertook a series of free, unannounced concerts in iceland. they hauled 40-plus people round 15 locations to the furthest flung corners of their homeland for their debut venture into live film, to create something, well, inspirational.

on their way they went to ghost towns, outsider art shrines, national parks, small community halls and the absolute middle-of-nowhere-ness of the highland wilderness, as well as playing the largest gig of their career (and in icelandic history) at their homecoming reykjavik show.

'heima' (icelandic for ""at home"" or ""homeland""), truly, shows sigur r√≥s as never before. whereas seeing the group live is normally a large-scale and sometimes overwhelming experience, making full use of lights and mesmeric visuals, 'heima' was always intended to reveal more of what was actually going on on stage. it does this via long-held close-ups and a rare intimate proximity, without ever once breaking the spell.

loosely based on a documentary format - and including personal reflections from the band - 'heima' also serves as an alternative primer for iceland the country, which is revealed as less stag destination-du-jour and more desolate, magical place where human beings have little right to trespass.

'heima' features performances of songs from all four sigur r√≥s albums, many radically reworked, as well as two exclusive new songs in 'guitardjamm', which was filmed inside an abandoned herring oil tank in the far west of the country, and the traditional 'a ferd til breidarfjardar 1922', performed with poet steindor andersen.

'heima' was directed by dean deblois, a long-time fan of the band and director of the oscar-nominated animated feature 'lilo & stitch', using an icelandic crew.

Wow this one is pretty late sorry about that guys I really haven't had chance to do a video until now.

Lyrics...

Sorry Im not out, my pockets feel like holes
I've got nothing I can offer you as I sit here in the cold
It's a story I've been telling for longer than I know
Where did all my riches go?

An inquest I am scared of cos I don't wanna know
I've been walking off my worries
Hoping they won't follow me around and around
But they always find me

Why won't you leave me alone?

I'm terrified of answers so I chose just not to ask
Surely everything is easier when you leave it in the past
But I know that I've been waking
Almost every single night
Dripping wet with deep regret lost in this endless fight

I am falling faster to the ground
Punched at every corner with my arms securely bound
I am waiting for existence to hold me by the hand
Explain that all's not lost for me 
and make me understand that I am free

My panic gets the upper hand as it tackles with me breath
I can see this is no playground fight
It's a battle to the death
I am chocking on the concrete with my faced pressed to the floor
The bastards won't defeat me can't you hear me scream for more.",1259,gdholden,C_Vtr8i87Do,,,4.5,,,1205645812000,"Sun, 16 Mar 2008 05:36:52 GMT",20080316053652,Music,,

			ANOTHER FEAURED VIDEO? Oh my dog.
Thanks for watching and commenting. 
Here are some thoughts for haters:

1. This is NOT a video-game video. I don't give a **** about video games or your stupid sony/nintendo arguments.
2. This video is boring and sucks. So I don't need you to tell me.
3. If you think I just pressed a bunch of random buttons you have a serious problem.
4. ""Dude, ever heard of headphones?"" Yeah thanks for the idea I'm gonna plug in some headphones to my tin whistle now.
5. The DS is not mine and I do play ""real"" instruments.
6. This is not a song, not a jig. They're four jigs so don't expect a short video.
7. If you're on youtube insulting on someone's video you're the one to get a life.

^^

------------------------------ --------------


I finally found an instrument I can play at night without waking up the neighbours. It's the DS game ""Daigasso Band Brothers"". 
And here I try to play some jigs before messing up. I think they are: 
The Lark on the Strand / Killavil Jig / Jim Ward's / Geese in the Bog. 
Many mistakes but it's quite hard with all the ornaments and the speed so I guess it's good enough for a few days of practice. (Damn, I failed the F# attempt...)(By the way, I was holding the camera with my neck.)

and we cant change that
so why even take my time?

Walking blind, all our words collide
We just keep on pushing through
keep on, keep on

Leave it to me to say a couple of things that I don't quite mean

Something tells me- 
this may be my intuition-
My thoughts keep moving into this direction
Shame theres nothing to conclude...

You've got a way to get my attention 
When I'm searching for the pieces I can't find
Doubts arise, will your puzzle fit with mine?
Shame there's nothing to conclude...

Take it or leave it, I can't be sure if your right for me...
 so I'll take it slow for you

It's true we know that we don't know
and we cant change that
so why even take my time?

Walking blind, all our words collide
We just keep on pushing through
keep on, keep on

Leave it to me to say a couple of things that I don't quite mean
I know how it seems
If you can try and understand that     I don't know what I want
but I know who I am...

Zero Integrity

i never said that i had any answers
i never claimed to be the better man
i've got no integrity to cling to
i don't have myself a backup plan

for twenty some odd years i've made a mess of things
i've lost most of the friendships that i've made
and i've burned a lot of bridges and it hurts me still to say
but i never intended it that way
yeah i never meant to make you want to punch me out
that night in Delaware outside the club
cause i know you had it shitty growing up and i did too
but if you forgive me i will forgive you

cause you make me want to stand in my fertility
a sellout doesn't value his own song
and i know i messed around a lot before i fell for you
but no one's ever loved you like i do
no one's ever loved you like i do

Zero Integrity

i never said that i had any answers
i never claimed to be the better man
i've got no integrity to cling to
i don't have myself a backup plan

for twenty some odd years i've made a mess of things
i've lost most of the friendships that i've made
and i've burned a lot of bridges and it hurts me still to say
but i never intended it that way
yeah i never meant to make you want to punch me out
that night in Delaware outside the club
cause i know you had it shitty growing up and i did too
but if you forgive me i will forgive you

cause you make me want to stand in my fertility
a sellout doesn't value his own song
and i know i messed around a lot before i fell for you
but no one's ever loved you like i do
no one's ever loved you like i do

LYRICS

Four, three, two, one

Listen up, ya'll, 'cause this is it
The numbers we're making are so vicious

Mathmaticious expeditious can be kind of scary
I hope my answers aren't radical or imaginary
I convert percents to fractions, it brings me some satisfaction
Like scientific notation and order of operations

Mathmaticious (repetitious)
Gets me expeditious
My answers may get vicious
My eraser's left in stitches
I make wishes (woo-ah)
I get the answer right, right
And I'll be staying up all night just to check what I write

Mathmaticious (The Pythagorean Theory)
Mathmaticious (Finds the hypotenuse for me)
Mathmaticious (Or I'll use trigonometry)
I'm Mathmaticious (d-d-d-d-d-decimal, decimal)

Locus of the points
Locus of the points
Locus of the points (points is echoing)

I'm up about figuring out greatest common factors
And when I make a pie chart I'm in need of a protractor
The angle of elevation, thanks to my calculations
Turns out to be 43, a prime number

I'm Mathmaticious (Mathmaticious) 
It makes me so ambitious
My answers are judicious
Calculator never glitches
It's my mission
I get the answer right, right
And I'll be staying up all night just to check what I write

Mathmaticious (What's the probability?)
Mathmaticious (Of me not labeling my axis)
Mathmaticious (When graphing inequalities)
Mathmaticious (hold, hold, hold, hold, hold up, check your work)

Computing areas
Quadratic formula
Graphing parabolas
I think they're all so cool
It's my soul commitment
That I ace the Regents
Sin, cosine and tangent
Are my favorite tools

I divide, multiply, add, subtract, round off and simplify
I divide, multiply, add, subtract, round off and simplify
Is it whole?  Rational?  Factor out, substitute, solve for x
Is it whole?  Rational?  Factor, factor, factor, hit the pi key

LYRICS

Four, three, two, one

Listen up, ya'll, 'cause this is it
The numbers we're making are so vicious

Mathmaticious expeditious can be kind of scary
I hope my answers aren't radical or imaginary
I convert percents to fractions, it brings me some satisfaction
Like scientific notation and order of operations

Mathmaticious (repetitious)
Gets me expeditious
My answers may get vicious
My eraser's left in stitches
I make wishes (woo-ah)
I get the answer right, right
And I'll be staying up all night just to check what I write

Mathmaticious (The Pythagorean Theory)
Mathmaticious (Finds the hypotenuse for me)
Mathmaticious (Or I'll use trigonometry)
I'm Mathmaticious (d-d-d-d-d-decimal, decimal)

Locus of the points
Locus of the points
Locus of the points (points is echoing)

I'm up about figuring out greatest common factors
And when I make a pie chart I'm in need of a protractor
The angle of elevation, thanks to my calculations
Turns out to be 43, a prime number

I'm Mathmaticious (Mathmaticious) 
It makes me so ambitious
My answers are judicious
Calculator never glitches
It's my mission
I get the answer right, right
And I'll be staying up all night just to check what I write

Mathmaticious (What's the probability?)
Mathmaticious (Of me not labeling my axis)
Mathmaticious (When graphing inequalities)
Mathmaticious (hold, hold, hold, hold, hold up, check your work)

Computing areas
Quadratic formula
Graphing parabolas
I think they're all so cool
It's my soul commitment
That I ace the Regents
Sin, cosine and tangent
Are my favorite tools

I divide, multiply, add, subtract, round off and simplify
I divide, multiply, add, subtract, round off and simplify
Is it whole?  Rational?  Factor out, substitute, solve for x
Is it whole?  Rational?  Factor, factor, factor, hit the pi key

American Election Song - Lyrics ...,207,"American Election Song
Lyrics by James Falkofske
Music by Chris Snow (http://www.snowtunes.com/)

There are times when I question, what is right and what is wrong
But in this presidential election, I'm just prayin we can get along
There are too many problems, that aren't just red or blue
Gotta find a uniter, a leader who can pull us through     A-mer-i-ca, A-meri-ca, A-meri-ca
   Open up your arms, and embrace the world
   A-mer-i-ca, A-meri-ca, A-meri-ca



We all live on this one blue marble, just a fly speck in the universe
Global warming, ozone depletion, oil energy becomes a curse
Making babies, making buildings, making vehicles without restraint
We believe the patient is thriving, even though the pulse is getting faint     A-mer-i-ca, A-meri-ca, A-meri-ca
   Open up your eyes, and save the world
   A-mer-i-ca, A-meri-ca, A-meri-ca



We no longer love our neighbors, we make no effort to connect as friends
And our children become strangers, watching T-V from birth to Depends
We build our private castles, becoming prisoners within the walls
If we need to talk to a fam-i-ly mem-ber, we grab the cell to place the call     A-mer-i-ca, A-meri-ca, A-meri-ca
   Open up your hearts, and love the world
   A-mer-i-ca, A-meri-ca, A-meri-ca



What will our great-grand-chil-dren, think of what we leave be-hind
Mortga-ging our whole exist-ence, acting as though we lost our mind
Instead of working sixty-hours, and falling asleep in-front of the television set
Reduce, re-use, recycle, and live within the pay we get     America, America, let's save the future, from our selves
   America, let's lead the way again
   America, America, America
   Open up your minds to another way

Breakfast at Huckabee's,233,"This is a supporter video for the Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee that a friend of mine (Jared Shelton) and I made for his website. Hopefully the powers that be will put it up on his blog or something.

It is to the tune of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" by Deep Blue Something but the lyrics are by yours truly. And here they are:

---

You said you've got nothing in common
With the candidates to choose from
And you're losing heart
You'll say the Big Three don't do it for you
Their negative ads bore you
And you just might stay home

So I said, ""What about voting for Huckabee?""
She said, ""I think I remember that man,
And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked him.""
And I said, ""Well, he's the best hope we've got.""

You see he's the only one who's for them
Faith, Family and Freedom
In the right order
So what now? It seems he's the best for us
He's even got Chuck Norris
Telling us how it's gonna be

(When the eyes of the ranger fall upon you
You better like Mike)

So I said, ""What about voting for Huckabee?""
She said, ""I think I remember that man,
And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked him.""

'Get Outta Our Town (Caucus Lame...,193,"By Jason Walsmith/The Nadas and Kyle Munson/The Register

American Election Song - Lyrics ...,207,"American Election Song
Lyrics by James Falkofske
Music by Chris Snow (http://www.snowtunes.com/)

There are times when I question, what is right and what is wrong
But in this presidential election, I'm just prayin we can get along
There are too many problems, that aren't just red or blue
Gotta find a uniter, a leader who can pull us through     A-mer-i-ca, A-meri-ca, A-meri-ca
   Open up your arms, and embrace the world
   A-mer-i-ca, A-meri-ca, A-meri-ca



We all live on this one blue marble, just a fly speck in the universe
Global warming, ozone depletion, oil energy becomes a curse
Making babies, making buildings, making vehicles without restraint
We believe the patient is thriving, even though the pulse is getting faint     A-mer-i-ca, A-meri-ca, A-meri-ca
   Open up your eyes, and save the world
   A-mer-i-ca, A-meri-ca, A-meri-ca



We no longer love our neighbors, we make no effort to connect as friends
And our children become strangers, watching T-V from birth to Depends
We build our private castles, becoming prisoners within the walls
If we need to talk to a fam-i-ly mem-ber, we grab the cell to place the call     A-mer-i-ca, A-meri-ca, A-meri-ca
   Open up your hearts, and love the world
   A-mer-i-ca, A-meri-ca, A-meri-ca



What will our great-grand-chil-dren, think of what we leave be-hind
Mortga-ging our whole exist-ence, acting as though we lost our mind
Instead of working sixty-hours, and falling asleep in-front of the television set
Reduce, re-use, recycle, and live within the pay we get     America, America, let's save the future, from our selves
   America, let's lead the way again
   America, America, America
   Open up your minds to another way

Breakfast at Huckabee's,233,"This is a supporter video for the Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee that a friend of mine (Jared Shelton) and I made for his website. Hopefully the powers that be will put it up on his blog or something.

It is to the tune of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" by Deep Blue Something but the lyrics are by yours truly. And here they are:

---

You said you've got nothing in common
With the candidates to choose from
And you're losing heart
You'll say the Big Three don't do it for you
Their negative ads bore you
And you just might stay home

So I said, ""What about voting for Huckabee?""
She said, ""I think I remember that man,
And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked him.""
And I said, ""Well, he's the best hope we've got.""

You see he's the only one who's for them
Faith, Family and Freedom
In the right order
So what now? It seems he's the best for us
He's even got Chuck Norris
Telling us how it's gonna be

(When the eyes of the ranger fall upon you
You better like Mike)
