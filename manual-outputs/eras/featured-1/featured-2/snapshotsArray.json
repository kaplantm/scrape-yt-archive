Sheehan is camped outside President Bush’s home in Crawford, Texas, waiting for a chance to speak to him about her son... wanting to know his life was not lost in vain.        We went to the vigil held at 24th Street and Camelback in Phoenix. It was a peaceful yet vocal protest. There were candles, placards and cheers as cars went by honking their horns in support.        The footage here is raw. I wanted to approximate the feel of the event.

No streets were closed, for Lelouch was unable to obtain a permit.  The driver completed the course in about 9 minutes, reaching nearly 140 MPH in some stretches. The footage reveals him running real red lights, nearly hitting real pedestrians, and driving the wrong way up real one-way streets.  Upon showing the film in public for the first time, Lelouch was arrested. He has never revealed the identity of the driver, and the film went underground until a DVD release a few years ago.

Hosted by Jackie Bird (BBC Scotland News anchor) and Donny Monroe formally lead singer of the band Runrig - See the fireworks go off Live from Edinburgh castle, normally the biggest New year party in the world. This year no Cannon Gun was fired by the infamous Tam the Gun, in real life known as, Staff Sergeant Thomas McKay, known as Tam the Gun, died at his home early on Thursday morning, 17th November 2005 at the age of 60. He had been suffering from cancer. :-( So for the first Scottish New Year in many years there was no gun fired on the hour chime, Tam's whisky lay waiting on top on the Cannon, and a lone piper played as the Fireworks went off as a mark of respect to Tam. He will be sadly missed here. But we still had the best Hogmanay (New years Eve) party in the world, as always we Scots know how to hold a party,people come here every New year from all over Europe and the rest of the world just for the all night party, we are a proud nation and we keep our traditions and heritage, and are proud of it. Enjoy the video, sorry I wanted to show all, but YouTube only allow 100 MB max, and my Video exceeded that, compressing the video only made the quality really bad, so it's best this way. The beginning brings a tear to the eyes... Happy New Year 2006, and thanks for all your kind comments.

Produced by revered pop craftsman Richard X. Heyman with Nancy Leigh and Spiff Wiegand and mixed by Kurt Reil of the Gripweeds, REDBEARD combines the genre-defying musicality of The Band, the earthy sincerity of Wilco and The Jayhawks, and the quirky pop smarts of Ben Folds Five and Guster for a welcome respite from the irony, detachment and jadedness found in much of today's new music. THE RANDY BANDITS will be hosting a CD Release Party for REDBEARD Friday, Feb. 17 in the Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard St., New York City. Show time is 8 p.m., with Byron Isaacs of Ollabelle and Tom Warnick opening. Tickets $10. Info: 212-219-3132 or www.knittingfactory.com.  REDBEARD encapsulates THE RANDY BANDITS' quest to put out new music in an entertaining way, to captivate fans (a.k.a. Fandits) with sincerity as well as lunacy, and to do something meaningful in a culture and business currently deluged with artifice and irony. The songs on REDBEARD swing from Rock to Country to Bluegrass to Jazz to Soul to Blues to Gospel with lots of hybrids, a jillion instruments traded amongst the musicians, and soaring vocal harmonies. The band's lyrics reflect the sensibility of their leader, award-winning playwright-turned-songwriter Jim Knable (\"Spain\"), who sings, plays acoustic guitar and sax, and is joined in THE RANDY BANDITS by Russ Kaplan (keyboards, vocals), Stephen Aleman (vocals, percussion), Spiff Wiegand (vocals, trumpet, mandolin, electric guitar, accordion and more), Chris Murphy (bass, vocals, electric guitar) and Adam Farrell (drums).  Together, they've focused attention to arrangement and performance since THE RANDY BANDITS' 2003 EP, The Woman ... or the Blues. The folky abandon has been left behind, but the spontaneity and downright madness their audiences love remains in full force.  We're sincere musical adventurers who believe in connecting to our audience with fun, humor and humanity,\" says Knable. \"We're not ironic. We're not about pop culture trendiness.

Produced by revered pop craftsman Richard X. Heyman with Nancy Leigh and Spiff Wiegand and mixed by Kurt Reil of the Gripweeds, REDBEARD combines the genre-defying musicality of The Band, the earthy sincerity of Wilco and The Jayhawks, and the quirky pop smarts of Ben Folds Five and Guster for a welcome respite from the irony, detachment and jadedness found in much of today's new music. THE RANDY BANDITS will be hosting a CD Release Party for REDBEARD Friday, Feb. 17 in the Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard St., New York City. Show time is 8 p.m., with Byron Isaacs of Ollabelle and Tom Warnick opening. Tickets $10. Info: 212-219-3132 or www.knittingfactory.com.  REDBEARD encapsulates THE RANDY BANDITS' quest to put out new music in an entertaining way, to captivate fans (a.k.a. Fandits) with sincerity as well as lunacy, and to do something meaningful in a culture and business currently deluged with artifice and irony. The songs on REDBEARD swing from Rock to Country to Bluegrass to Jazz to Soul to Blues to Gospel with lots of hybrids, a jillion instruments traded amongst the musicians, and soaring vocal harmonies. The band's lyrics reflect the sensibility of their leader, award-winning playwright-turned-songwriter Jim Knable (\"Spain\"), who sings, plays acoustic guitar and sax, and is joined in THE RANDY BANDITS by Russ Kaplan (keyboards, vocals), Stephen Aleman (vocals, percussion), Spiff Wiegand (vocals, trumpet, mandolin, electric guitar, accordion and more), Chris Murphy (bass, vocals, electric guitar) and Adam Farrell (drums).  Together, they've focused attention to arrangement and performance since THE RANDY BANDITS' 2003 EP, The Woman ... or the Blues. The folky abandon has been left behind, but the spontaneity and downright madness their audiences love remains in full force.  We're sincere musical adventurers who believe in connecting to our audience with fun, humor and humanity,\" says Knable. \"We're not ironic. We're not about pop culture trendiness. We're about making really lasting music.\"  REDBEARD is available through www.randybandits.com, www.cdbaby.com, www.amazon.com and exclusively in Manhattan at The Mudtruck on Wall Street and in Brooklyn at Soundtracks on 7th Ave.","tags":["randy","bandits","knitting","factory","red","beard","music","EPK","mudtruck","brooklyn","story","of","your","life","capella\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChannels // Entertainment","Music"],"views":null,"author":"","videoId":"vTVcB5BxO1Y","uploadDate":"3 days ago by therandybandits","comments":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1139456329000,"dateFeatured":"Thu, 09 Feb 2006 03:38:49 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20060209033849"},{"title":"Pilot's eye view of a three day trip","description":"I made this video for my daughter to see where it is that I work.

Here she climbs onto my fingers and enjoys a snack of honey.  Note: This is not a Japanese giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia), but a Vespa ducalis, which comes really close in size. It is not a male, as someone claimed, it's a worker. Note the antennae and abdomen - males have an additional segment and a blunt abdomen, and long curved antennae. Their usual lifespan is merely several weeks, which is why I'm surprised myself. She isn't flying simply because she's busy eating. I caught her intending just to take some photos, but decided to keep her later. This is not in any way related to the cicada killer, it is a close relative of the European hornet Vespa crabro and the previously mentioned Japanese giant hornet. They never attack away from the nest. And yes, I have been stung by this species (but not this individual); it hurts somewhat; swollen hand, stiff fingers, but no lasting effect. She died naturally of old age.   Note also that this video is only to document how docile they can be away from the nest, and also the size of this magnificent insect.","tags":["Hornet","Hong","Kong","Asia","Vespa","ducalis","wasp","bee","pet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChannels // Education & Instructional","Hobbies & Interests","Pets & Animals"],"views":null,"author":"","videoId":"HuMS3KDNysM","uploadDate":"23 hours ago by vtropica","comments":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1142486836000,"dateFeatured":"Thu, 16 Mar 2006 05:27:16 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20060316052716"},{"title":"Space Camp","description":"From the creators of the Bittorrent Song, comes Space Camp.

Belegarth is a Medieval Combat Sport, to learn more about it check out: www.belegarth.com. This was a video of some wrestling on the sidelines in between battles. The difference between what we do and what LARPers do is that we focus on the combat and are full force, full contact - it's an athletic martial sport vs. being a bunch of D&D; geeks out in the woods tap fighting.

Because this is the 2nd half of the full lesson, watch the first part BEFORE you watch this. It will make a lot more sense.  Made this a few weeks back. There are some licks and riff ideas, as well as ways to get you thinking about how to come up with new things if you are stuck in a rut in your learning.  comments or questions, post or message me  enjoy    some of you are not understanding the purpose of this. if you are new to guitar, then of course you don't know what i'm showing here, and OBVIOUSLY this lesson isn't for you. However, if you have been playing a while and are in a slump where you can't come up with new ideas, this will help you out because it offers some new approaches at making riffs, etc. why some of you are so offended because you aren't good enough yet to understand this is ridiculous. go learn the basics, then come back and listen to my ideas.","tags":["guitar","lesson","shred","solo","metal","rock","neoclassic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChannels // Music"],"views":null,"author":"","videoId":"7AcPvRdd6OY","uploadDate":"6 days ago by neoclassic09","comments":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1145901022000,"dateFeatured":"Mon, 24 Apr 2006 17:50:22 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20060424175022"},{"title":"ice sculpture","description":"its a very good sculpture.
