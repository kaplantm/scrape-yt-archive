Rarely do I find appeal in them either as they are almost inevitably shrill whiny things that do not display depth and complexity to their acoustics.This mago (a type of didgeridoo from Western Arnhem Land, Australia), in contrast, is stellar. For a high A, it has incredible acoustic complexity and character. Its voice has a crisp precision and clarity that is rare in any key. This mago without a doubt is the best A key we've ever had.This mago benefits additionally from high back pressure which allows a player to play with ease. It also has tremendous power and loudness. A little screamer it is!Also worth mentioning is the totally natural bore, termite-eaten throughout. The mouthpiece end is perfectly sized and shaped, with the bore gradually increasing in size until you reach the bell end which is voluminous and clear. This piece of Stringybark (a type of Australian 'gum' or eucalyptus tree) really is a freak of nature...Take a listen here and let us know if this is the best A you have heard!For those who are interested, this didgeridoo was made by an Aboriginal woman, her name is Daphne Banyawarra. A profile for her can be found by following the link below:http://www.ididj.com.au/education/profiles/banyawarra.htmlThe didgeridoo player in this clip is an Aboriginal man by the name of Darryl Dikarrnga (sometimes spelt Digarrnga and Dikarrna), who is regarded as one of the best didgeridoo players of this particular style called Kunborrk.

It has become a guiding artistic theme for the duo, who are recipients of a 2008 Creative Capital Foundation Grant for \"We Own TV,\" a collaborative media project that promotes self-expression through visual media by bringing filmmaking education and equipment to Sierra Leonean youth. Project participants will collaboratively create and produce their own independent media which will be distributed via \"We Own TV's\" broadcast and online partners. Zach and Banker also continue to work closely with their friends \"Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars\" who, since the release of the film have become international stars and strident advocates for refugee rights.

That thing that modify your world and put crazy new ideas in your mind, that thing that makes you hate yourself and one minute later makes you believe your the greatest. That thing that makes you smile, laugh, dance, jump like lunatic. That thing that often is not finished but is on your reel. That thing that makes you be late. That thing that puts you under pressure. That thing that doesn't obliges you to sit in there when you don't want or you just don't \"feel good\" to sit there and make what you need to do, but when you sit by yourself there that thing makes sure that magic happens. That thing that makes your heart crazy. That thing that say \"every detail matters\", that thing that makes changes \"here and there\", that thing that when is finished you say \"yeah... I like it\" and months later you may say \"wow, it is great\" or \"I can't believe I was that bad\". That thing that creates the impossible. That thing that makes you climb the mountain and scream, \"thank you\". That thing that impulse yourself to make a video for a competition where the possibilities are so few. That thing that search the best quality. That thing that keeps you up to date with ads, animations, webs, movies, music... That thing that customizes all your stuffs. That thing that screams and makes you to forget anything. That thing that shows you the way to the most creative. That thingSo what's that thing \"THE THING\"?I cannot describe it in one word but I'm sure it's not the money or the fame.It is the love, the passion that God put in me of making something great, that makes you feel \"something\" when you get in touch with it, see it and hear it.

That thing that modify your world and put crazy new ideas in your mind, that thing that makes you hate yourself and one minute later makes you believe your the greatest. That thing that makes you smile, laugh, dance, jump like lunatic. That thing that often is not finished but is on your reel. That thing that makes you be late. That thing that puts you under pressure. That thing that doesn't obliges you to sit in there when you don't want or you just don't \"feel good\" to sit there and make what you need to do, but when you sit by yourself there that thing makes sure that magic happens. That thing that makes your heart crazy. That thing that say \"every detail matters\", that thing that makes changes \"here and there\", that thing that when is finished you say \"yeah... I like it\" and months later you may say \"wow, it is great\" or \"I can't believe I was that bad\". That thing that creates the impossible. That thing that makes you climb the mountain and scream, \"thank you\". That thing that impulse yourself to make a video for a competition where the possibilities are so few.

There are no fences around the reserves in Kenya and Tanzania allowing the animals to roam freely in search of new grasses for grazing. The wildebeest migration is one of the few large movements of game in the world. The wildebeest give birth to their calves in the South East Serengeti then move into the Western Serengeti before heading north to Masai Mara in July.  They feed on the lush grasses of the Mara until October as the Serengeti plains are too dry. In December, the rains return to the Serengeti as does the migration.  There are 1.3 million wildebeest; 200,000 zebra; and 350,000 gazelles estimated in the migration.  Of course all the lions follow these animals making the Mara the most predator-packed reserve in the world. Cheetahs are very difficult to see in most African parks, but they are very easily seen here. Wildebeest can't pass up the opportunity to drink as they cannot go longer than 5 days without water. They will risk life and limb to do so.  In the morning they might cross the croc- infested river only to re-cross the same river later in the afternoon. We camped for 16 days in the park at a community run Masai camp near Talek gate.

There are no fences around the reserves in Kenya and Tanzania allowing the animals to roam freely in search of new grasses for grazing. The wildebeest migration is one of the few large movements of game in the world. The wildebeest give birth to their calves in the South East Serengeti then move into the Western Serengeti before heading north to Masai Mara in July.  They feed on the lush grasses of the Mara until October as the Serengeti plains are too dry. In December, the rains return to the Serengeti as does the migration.  There are 1.3 million wildebeest; 200,000 zebra; and 350,000 gazelles estimated in the migration.  Of course all the lions follow these animals making the Mara the most predator-packed reserve in the world. Cheetahs are very difficult to see in most African parks, but they are very easily seen here. Wildebeest can't pass up the opportunity to drink as they cannot go longer than 5 days without water. They will risk life and limb to do so.  In the morning they might cross the croc- infested river only to re-cross the same river later in the afternoon.

At first I misunderstood the comment but then it clicked and I felt compelled to offer something.. anything. I know this song is going to change nothing; and I'm cautious calling it a protest song as I don't understand the situation fully (and I wouldn't want to upset anyone), but this is a tune I wrote in response to being repressed (I'm whatever guise) and how beautiful 'freedom' really is. I don't think anyone will ever understand that term fully but by singing and writing and thinking and speaking we can come somewhere close I'm sure. As a disclaimer, I'd say that, personally, the chords and melody are arbitrary; merely the carrier of the sentiment...Changing the subject ever so slightly I just wanted to say a big thank you to everyone that's shown support; it's overwhelming. An apology to anyone I've not yet responded to.. I've never been very good at juggling my time but I will be in touch.Thanks again..._________________Certainty In FreedomIf I had the will to talkI wonder if you'd give a thought To what I had to say - help make it go awayCos there's certainty in freedomAnd in that we must believe inCos I saw on the news todayIf I saw you in the street nowWould I look the other way?I hope I'm strong enough to say - help make it go awayWhen all you see is hatredSpirits crushed and souls deflatedEasy to leave it for another dayPeace is pushing for loveLove is leading the wayYou should follow its pathDarkness leads you astrayPeace is pushing for loveLove is leading the waySo this, my only voice to speakMy message strong, my tone is weakI find it hard to say - help make it go awayAnd if I come across obtuseI urge you now to cut the nooseDon't leave it for another dayPeace is pushing for loveLove is leading the wayYou should follow its pathDarkness leads you astrayPeace is pushing for loveLove is leading the wayIf I had the will to talkI wonder if you'd give a thought To what I had to say - help make it go awayCos there's certainty in freedomAnd in that we must believe inCos I saw on the news todayPeace is pushing for loveLove is leading the wayYou should follow its pathDarkness leads you astrayPeace is pushing for loveLove is leading the way_____________________PeaceAvailable on the 'Unequal Measures', available through http://www.krisrowley.com© Kris Rowley 2007","tags":[],"views":61132,"author":"zzzzzzzzap","videoId":"L9Wu1V1JAHw","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1212700658000,"dateFeatured":"Thu, 05 Jun 2008 21:17:38 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080605211738","categories":["Music"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"the world is at your fingertips","duration":315,"description":"for the taking.","tags":[],"views":351701,"author":"SupaDupaFlyGirl","videoId":"gQNY7Sti8FY","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1212700658000,"dateFeatured":"Thu, 05 Jun 2008 21:17:38 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080605211738","categories":["Science & Technology"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"Aimee Mann Freeway Video Contest","duration":142,"description":"Want a chance to sing with Aimee Mann live?

She started playing the violin at 23 months old, so we thought it would be fun to mark her unique odyssey by playing her violin around the world at key places.This is the first installment, with the most exciting moment being her concert in the Sahara. She rode in on a camel and played for 60 Berber kids that have no running water and have never seen a violin. The beauty that we are seeing and the kindness of people every where, makes this world seem like heaven. This experience  has been a great gift to us and we would like to share some of it with you.  Enjoy!To answer some of the repeated comments, this is not a performance nor is this child a prodigy. The title is about her name Mozart not the music which is Pachabel.It is a unique documentation of our open ended world tour that she wanted to do. You can hear her playing in other vids in our channel, but none are performances as that is not our purpose. She is just a kid who loves music and is good at it, but also loves most things kids love and has a full life. It took 18 months to make this video and it was hard enough to get the film, let alone decent sound in these crowded, noisy environments. Thus we did a montage conver as all do in these kinds of videos. She is young and it takes great concentration to play such sophisticated songs under such circumstances, but her nature is one of great joy as you can see in our other videos or website.We are not rich and travel and live on a total of 25,000 dollars a year.For more information about our open ended family journey around the world, living large on little with lots of how-to information on extended frugal travel, see our website:http://www.soultravelers3.com\n\t\t\t(more)\n\t\t\t(less)","tags":[],"views":496694,"author":"soultravelers3","videoId":"wn9rDTZj-m4","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1213578299000,"dateFeatured":"Mon, 16 Jun 2008 01:04:59 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080616010459","categories":["Travel & Events"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"The Worst Basketball Player Ever Speaks Out","duration":91,"description":"SUBSCRIBE!

I wrote this song with that in mind. LYRICS:One morning I clicked on Youtube to get my daily fixOf ukulele players who upload their latest flicksWhen a young girl's performance caught my searching eyesBut the words she sang took me by surprise.The lyrics were unseemly and her language pretty foulI couldn't believe I heard these words emanating from her mouth.I stopped the vid and unsubscribed from all her other flicks Because ukuleles and foul language do not mix.CHORUSUkuleles and foul language don't mixIt cheapens all your music and makes your viewers sick.Ukes make people smile! You don't need a bag of tricksUkuleles and foul language don't mix.When I play my ukulele, people pause and turn their headsChildren stop their playing and listen to me instead.It's like I am this noble instrument's ambassadorThe songs I sing shouldn't have language that's poor. Ukuleles and foul language don't mixIt cheapens all your music and makes your viewers sick.You set up an example by the things you do and sayDo you really want to be known to folks that way?BRIDGE:You don't sing bad words when you're with family (like your Grandma?)Why would you swear on Youtube, then, where all the world can see?Ukuleles and foul language don't mixDirty words are the aural equivalent of pornographic pics.Ukes make people smile!

I was intrigued by the thought of snow and was looking at a picture of Mochi in her winter clothes. This song reminds me of our happier days and also the not so happy ones. Which is why I titled the song \"Schizophrenic snowflakes\"The song goes from a Major key to Minor and back throughout the whole song. I thought it was kinda cool. I guess it represents the good times, to bad, and back to good again. The beginning riff is supposed to create an image of snowflakes falling. Due to my inspiration of the snow on Mochi's winter clothes. Plus, the song gives you the feel like you're ice skating.Please enjoy my original composition.

I wrote this song with that in mind. LYRICS:One morning I clicked on Youtube to get my daily fixOf ukulele players who upload their latest flicksWhen a young girl's performance caught my searching eyesBut the words she sang took me by surprise.The lyrics were unseemly and her language pretty foulI couldn't believe I heard these words emanating from her mouth.I stopped the vid and unsubscribed from all her other flicks Because ukuleles and foul language do not mix.CHORUSUkuleles and foul language don't mixIt cheapens all your music and makes your viewers sick.Ukes make people smile! You don't need a bag of tricksUkuleles and foul language don't mix.When I play my ukulele, people pause and turn their headsChildren stop their playing and listen to me instead.It's like I am this noble instrument's ambassadorThe songs I sing shouldn't have language that's poor. Ukuleles and foul language don't mixIt cheapens all your music and makes your viewers sick.You set up an example by the things you do and sayDo you really want to be known to folks that way?BRIDGE:You don't sing bad words when you're with family (like your Grandma?)Why would you swear on Youtube, then, where all the world can see?Ukuleles and foul language don't mixDirty words are the aural equivalent of pornographic pics.Ukes make people smile! You don't need a bag of tricksUkuleles and foul language do not mix.Chords: C, F, G, D, A","tags":[],"views":240430,"author":"UKISOCIETY","videoId":"oVK3I_PYSXE","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1213898660000,"dateFeatured":"Thu, 19 Jun 2008 18:04:20 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080619180420","categories":["Music"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"Guacamole Ukulele Song","duration":196,"description":"Interested in buying our CDs?

Is our existence just coincidence? Do little things matter?The narrator of The Danish Poet considers these questions as we follow Kasper, a poet whose creative well has run dry, on a holiday to Norway to meet the famous writer, Sigrid Undset. As Kasper's quest for inspiration unfolds, it appears that a spell of bad weather, an angry dog, slippery barn planks, a careless postman, hungry goats and other seemingly unrelated factors might play important roles in the big scheme of things after all.

It wins a game of Snafu. I guess people could say I &quot;cheated&quot; by using electricity to power on of the cars, but I have done that with most of my non videotaped machines. Anyways, the steps are below:<br/>1) Insert marble into top of wood block marble game.<br/>2) The marble hits some dominoes with just enough force to topple them.<br/>3) The dominoes his another marble which rolls and skids down a Scrabble board.<br/>4) That marble hits another defective marble with a semi-flat bottom (which is how it is balancing on a downhill slope) and bounces it off down a ramp made of scrabble boards. <br/>5) The marble hits dominoes which ascend with the help of wood block &quot;stairs.&quot;<br/>6) The domino at the top hits a cylindrical block which slides down what is meant to be used as a marble slide.<br/>7) The block hits a bridge which has a marble just barely held on by friction and moves it just enough to overcome the friction and descend down the bridge.<br/>8) The marble enters a plastic marble game and exits through a ramp at the bottom. <br/>9) The marble is transfered to another ramp and hits more dominoes at the end. <br/>10) The dominoes hit a toy car/train that goes down a ramp and hits a running electric car.<br/>11) *CHEATER ALERT* The car uses electric power to climb up and around a track before falling onto (what a surprise) more dominoes. <br/>12) The dominoes hit a wooden train set piece which topples and shakes a yardstick ramp. <br/>13) A marble game on the end of the ramp receives the vibration of the block falling and makes a marble roll down though it.<br/>14) The marble falls upon a wooden track and creates just enough vibration to get the train on it to roll down.<br/>15) The train hits a wooden train set piece standing upright which falls onto the button to use the catapult and gets the marble inside in the winning area.<br/><br/>Zoom in stupidly for victory.<br/><br/>EDIT: Wow!

Using the original interview recording as the soundtrack, director Josh Raskin has woven a visual narrative which tenderly romances Lennon's every word in a cascading flood of multipronged animation. Raskin marries the terrifyingly genius pen work of James Braithwaite with masterful digital illustration by Alex Kurina, resulting in a spell-binding vessel for Lennon's boundless wit, and timeless message.","tags":[],"views":156778,"author":"imetthewalrus","videoId":"jmR0V6s3NKk","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1215278083000,"dateFeatured":"Sat, 05 Jul 2008 17:14:43 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080705171443","categories":["Film & Animation"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"The Big Empty","duration":1274,"description":"Now Playing in the YouTube Screening Roomhttp://www.youtube.com/ytscreeningroomThe Big EmptyFrom Wholphin No. 1http://store.mcsweeneys.net/index.cfm/fuseaction/catalog.det ail/object_id/8f85e2e0-3ab9-40cf-9b2b-7983c3520611/WholphinN o1.cfmDirected by Lisa Chang and Thomas SigelStarring Selma Blair and Elias KoteasProduced by Daniel DubieckiStory by Alison Smith from McSweeney's No 11Visit the Wholphin website here:http://www.wholphindvd.com","tags":[],"views":78646,"author":"wholphindvd","videoId":"wohxTicIrL0","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1215278083000,"dateFeatured":"Sat, 05 Jul 2008 17:14:43 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080705171443","categories":["Film & Animation"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"School of Life","duration":415,"description":"This will be the most important lesson of your life.

My video views had gone up from 400 to 25000 literally, over night...  What!!!???  The world of internet is a very crazy place!  And my myspace page, which I had completely forgotten about, had so many \"friend's requests\"...!Thank you so very much for all of your lovely comments and messages.  I read them ALL and of course my head was huge for a while until I spoke to my mum who brought me right back down to planet earth...haha:-0  But anyway, I really didn't expect this reaction from you all, it was just a quick video I did very geekishly to test out my new web-cam!  (And yes, it turns out 'not so good' in the dark!... thanks for your advice though, I will get a light bulb!  Why didn't I think-a that!?  haha:)  I'm not quite sure how this has happened but I guess I have to thank the person (Mark?) who put me on the boingboing.net website?  Thank you!!!xxxxxHere is my 3rd video; the song is called Summer Face.  By the way, the other voice is also me, so please don't think that I made someone sing the harmonies and I was mean enough to hog the camera...Some questions answered...Q:  Can I buy your CD? A:  Thank you so much, that is so nice...  Didn't think anyone would say that...ever!  I have been trying to get a CD together for friggin' years!  I've been on a very long journey to find the sound that I am comfortable with.  I even tried being a Rock Chick once...oh my god!  So not me.  How uncomfortable and awkward was I!?...  I'm a real geek at heart (I love it!), couldn't pull off being 'cool' to save my life!  But anyway, at the time I wasn't confident enough to stick to what I believed in and what I loved, and in that process of trying to be appealing or trying to please others, I actually totally lost myself and was very confused for a long time, didn't really know what was what...hmmm...  So!  Many failed demos and \"new directions\" later I am finally going to record my next EP/Album this summer (hopefully, I'll manage to get the funding together...Come on Universe!  Can't believe I just said \"universe\"...).  So the answer is no, I haven't got a CD but watch this space, I will keep you posted:)Q:  Is it really a Ukulele!?A:  many of you didn't believe that it was a ukulele because it has 6 strings but it is quite simply a 6 string tenor ukulele.  2 of the strings are just doubled up in octaves.  And yes!  I know my ukulele playing is not brilliant but I only started playing it in Feb (this year), so I'm still learning.  I was so uninspired and bored with the piano, probably because I teach it (I am a piano and singing teacher)...  I still love it but I needed something fresh and new.  So!  I met Alfred (the ukulele)...I know it's quite sad to name your instrument but mine came with a name when I bought it!  The shop-man said \"Aha!  I have the perfect instrument for you...wait here a second... (after some digging)... here it is!  It's called Alfred!\"...  So there we go...Q:  Do you write the songs?A:  Yes, I do.  Well, obviously apart from the covers.Q:  What is your nationality?A:  I am half Scottish (mum) and half Japanese (dad).Q:  Will you marry me?A:  Ok, but only if you become my house wife.  I'll call you wifey:)  You'll have to do all the cooking and cleaning + look after the kids!...  no seriously, I'm very flattered but I'm not the marrying kind.  Haha:0Q:  Were you named after the cartoon cow?A: This one was my favourite!!!  I totally laughed out loud!:0  Lets say yes for now, I would love that! :)Thanks a million:)  and more very soon!

It's subtitled in Chinese, but worth a watch even if you don't read Chinese. I'll sum up the main points in English below the video.Before I list Alice's main points, I need to first explain some background. In the video, Alice discusses the Chinese sign language counterparts of the Chinese words 聋哑人 (literally, \"deaf mute person\") and 聋人 (\"Deaf person\"). The former is the most common way to refer to a Deaf person in Chinese, whereas the latter is the word many in the Chinese Deaf community wishes everyone would use. 哑巴 is the word for \"mute,\" and it's definitely not polite.Alice's main points are:     * The Deaf Chinese are used to using signs for \"deaf-mute\" (聋哑人) and \"mute\" (哑巴) but these signs are not respectful to Deaf people.     * Overseas, Deaf communities stopped using the expression \"deaf-mute\" 20 years ago, and only China persists.     * It was foreigners that appreciated that within the character for deaf, \"聋,\" is the character 龙, meaning \"dragon,\" a traditional mythological protector being. That's pretty cool!     * The traditional Chinese sign for \"deaf-mute\" (聋哑人) is loaded with negative connotations, but there is an international symbol for for \"Deaf person\" (聋人) that we should be using.     * The word \"deaf-mute\" (聋哑人) should also be rejected because \"deaf\" and \"mute\" are two separate concepts; deaf does not have to mean unable to speak, and being unable to speak does not mean one must be deaf.     * Some Deaf people believe basic, improvised signs are lowly and spoil the aesthetics of the language. This is wrong, because sign language is the language of the Deaf, developed by the Deaf, with its own grammar and special characteristics.     * There are two kinds of sign language: literary sign language (文法手语), used to reflect mainstream written language, and natural sign language (自然手语), the everyday language of the Deaf.     * Deaf people are not handicapped people (残疾人). We have our own culture and language. Let's unite and improve ourselves.     * The Chinese Deaf community needs to be bolder, to candidly discuss issues and to struggle together.     * Remember, it's 聋人, not 聋哑人. Spread the word: 聋人.I have to say, this video fascinated me. There's so much there, linguistically (not to mention that it was filmed next to a sushi conveyor belt, which is just damn cool). I think you can tell when a gifted orator makes a stirring speech in a foreign language, and this is the same feeling I get watching Alice deliver her message. It's inspiring.My favorite part of the video is the stretch from 1:12 to 1:22. You can easily tell from Alice's facial expression that the sign for \"deaf-mute\" (聋哑人), which uses the pinky finger, is distasteful, and that one should use the index finger instead to say \"Deaf person\" (聋人). It's not just a matter of arbitrary signs, though. In Chinese sign language, the sign for \"good\" (好) is the \"thumbs up\" sign. The opposite of that is thumb in, pinky out. That's the sign for \"bad\" (不好). So the meaning of the sign for \"deaf-mute\" is clear: \"ears bad, mouth bad.\" Quite negative. The newer sign uses the index finger, drawing attention to the ear and mouth without disparaging it. You can watch Alice put down the negativity of the pinky finger and choose the index finger instead.Check out Alice's other videos. Not all of them have Chinese subtitles, but one interesting one that does is an interview with Deaf rapper Signmark. Alice interviews him in international sign language.I haven't watched them all, but it looks like none of Alice's videos to date have English subtitles. I'm working on convincing her that it would be worthwhile.","tags":[],"views":182676,"author":"huxiaoshu","videoId":"8j4bkQ09Bbs","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1217439830000,"dateFeatured":"Wed, 30 Jul 2008 17:43:50 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080730174350","categories":["People & Blogs"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"The Ball","duration":235,"description":"An ASL classifier story about a ball.","tags":[],"views":51991,"author":"mangler989","videoId":"bOoIcuA-0A4","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":2.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1217439830000,"dateFeatured":"Wed, 30 Jul 2008 17:43:50 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080730174350","categories":["Education"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"RUMBLES IN THE BAR!","duration":341,"description":"Hey everyone, that bass isn't working on the youtube.

Thanks again YouTube for featuring me!... Some cool things to do:1) Over D minor I think mostly D dorian in the left hand.  In the right hand however, I think D, Db, and Eb Dorian.  Using half step chromatically \"out\" scales is the easiest way to add and resolve tension.  You may also want to try the tritone which is Ab Dorian.  You can and should take the LH out too occasionally as well.2) When the bass player is pedaling the I or V you have ANY option of diatonic scales to play since he is implying no scale with his walking.  These include (but are not limited to) D harmonic minor, D mel. minor, D dim, D altered, D major, D lydian, and many more!  You can also play with half step chromaticism while doing this!3) It's easy to want to over play in a modal tune where you know the basic scale very well.  A way to break up the monotony of single note lines is block chords.  I use 4th voicings in the LH w/ octaves, single notes, clusters, and thirds in the RH.  It's a hip and updated way to play the George Shearing style over modern tunes.4) Cluster Vocings:  Practice just dropping letting your hand randomly fall on the piano.  Remember, for it to sound best all the notes you \"fall\" in to should relate to the scale you're improvising with.  Clare Fischer used to do this, but he often didn't worry about scale relationships until AFTER the fact.5) If you don't own \"Kind of Blue\" go buy it!  Now...Read Mark Levine's section on \"So What\" chords in his \"Jazz Piano Book.\"  He talks extensively about how to alter standard So What chords.  Playing contrunpuntaly with quartal vocings is a great thing.  It's used extensively by pianists Hal Galper and Enrico Pieranunzi.  If you haven't heard of Enrico check out \"Live in Paris.\"  It's one of the most impressive trio albums I've ever heard.

It's a hip and updated way to play the George Shearing style over modern tunes.4) Cluster Vocings:  Practice just dropping letting your hand randomly fall on the piano.  Remember, for it to sound best all the notes you \"fall\" in to should relate to the scale you're improvising with.  Clare Fischer used to do this, but he often didn't worry about scale relationships until AFTER the fact.5) If you don't own \"Kind of Blue\" go buy it!  Now...Read Mark Levine's section on \"So What\" chords in his \"Jazz Piano Book.\"  He talks extensively about how to alter standard So What chords.  Playing contrunpuntaly with quartal vocings is a great thing.  It's used extensively by pianists Hal Galper and Enrico Pieranunzi.  If you haven't heard of Enrico check out \"Live in Paris.\"  It's one of the most impressive trio albums I've ever heard.  Check him out here:http://www.myspace.com/enricopieranunzi  Thanks to Lot2Learn for helping me with this one.","tags":[],"views":34750,"author":"tjjazzpiano","videoId":"9Tzl5N5cwcc","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1218033399000,"dateFeatured":"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 14:36:39 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080806143639","categories":["Music"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"How to play Pan-Flute","duration":302,"description":"Brad White http://pan-flute.com/letter shows how to play the panflute.

At first, it was just random use of a video camera, plus a few pictures taken during a visit in September of 2006. Of course, this was before we knew that Mom had a collapsed lung. She went in for tests, and it was discovered that she had Stage IV Lung Cancer. As we learned of the cancer diagnosis in October of 2006, we tried to get Mom down to California (from Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada). It was a race against logistics and paperwork (i.e. obtaining documentation in order to cross a border and travel), which we unfortunately lost. Mom suffered a stroke, ironically on the same day as she received her birth certificate, which would have allowed her to travel to Southern California. The stroke left her left side completely paralyzed, and she was stuck in the hospital, no longer the independent woman she once was. We were summoned to fly up immediately, as we were told by her doctors that her death would not be far behind. Mom proved them all wrong, and lived for four more months. Of course, the quality of life was minimal at best. There was no treatment, since the cancer was discovered so late, and due to the stroke. We have since learned that often times, a biopsy can knock loose cancerous material within a tumor, which can cause a stroke. It was extremely difficult to watch her suffering in a hospital bed, and wondering why her last months had to be made that much worse due to the stroke. So, Mom never did get to come see where we live in California. We continued to videotape the entire ordeal, so that family (who couldn't be with us at that time) could see everything. We ended up with approximately 90 minutes of raw footage, which has been edited down to the 10 minutes allowed here. First, we have done this to honor Mom's last wishes: tell people not to smoke. Second, we have completed this very emotional project to honor her memory, and to help us as we continue through the grieving process. Finally, we are aware that much of the anti-smoking media is not so real to life--it doesn't show the suffering, what the families go through, and the pain that cigarettes actually cause. This documentary is \"non-Hollywood\". We have omitted certain things that one might find offensive, including her IV, vomiting, bodily functions, and her actual death itself, which was obviously painful. Instead, we have brought many different segments together, which still conveys our overall message: DON'T SMOKE!In a letter dated September 24, 2006, from Mom:\"Try not to worry about my health. I go for a CAT-SCAN on October 4th. I should have the results about a week later. The appointments are taking a long time, so I must not be in such dire shape, or they would rush them. I'm glad you never really had the desire to smoke. What do your lungs look like after all of those years of second-hand smoke? I can't wait to see you and Patti more often. Gotta go for now. Love Forever, Mom\"To conclude, one can compare smoking cigarettes to a slow-motion car accident. At any time, you can get out of the car before it crashes. It is your choice.

Furthermore, you may be driving your own car, but please remember that you take passengers along for the ride.","tags":[],"views":182125,"author":"sonicbondage","videoId":"u_8BerrJg0M","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":0,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1220661268000,"dateFeatured":"Sat, 06 Sep 2008 00:34:28 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080906003428","categories":["News & Politics"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"Kate shaves her head!","duration":177,"description":"Kate is sooo awsome, she shaved her head for cancer patients cuz they make wigs.if u want to message kate she has a myspacehttp://www.myspace.com/k8notsk8","tags":[],"views":227755,"author":"thouartkathe...","videoId":"6B3m5nbqqvw","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1220661268000,"dateFeatured":"Sat, 06 Sep 2008 00:34:28 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080906003428","categories":["People & Blogs"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"Screw You, Cancer!","duration":84,"description":"Join me in thwarting cancer's evil plan to take over the world at http://www.standup2cancer.org/teams?tq=resident  More info on the show at http://www.theresident.net","tags":[],"views":30652,"author":"theresident","videoId":"ztGasW9r0Nc","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1220661268000,"dateFeatured":"Sat, 06 Sep 2008 00:34:28 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080906003428","categories":["Nonprofits & Activism"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"Lars Ulrich of Metallica Thanks YouTube Fans","duration":173,"description":"Lars congratulates YouTube users for their great versions of Metallica songs.

This is Paradise. Here, in a brightly and cheerfully coloured suburban home, we meet John Small. He's an optimistic, ambitious little man dedicated to the future, to success in his career. John is absorbed in his work and his daily routine and blissfully oblivious of his lonely and disillusioned wife, Jane.As his perfect little life unravels, John remains obstinate and focused on his goals. But John is misguided in his efforts, unable to realize the value of what he has and what he stands to lose. Happiness eludes him.Directed by Jesse Rosensweet. Produced in 2007.","tags":[],"views":63729,"author":"nfb","videoId":"jo1pkr3DwCo","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1221001831000,"dateFeatured":"Tue, 09 Sep 2008 23:10:31 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080909231031","categories":["Film & Animation"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"Lars Ulrich of Metallica Thanks YouTube Fans","duration":173,"description":"Lars congratulates YouTube users for their great versions of Metallica songs.

It was made from shooting still photographs of key movements. The characters were photographed up against solid colors and cut out in Adobe Photoshop. The scenes were composited and animated together in Adobe After Effects. Final cutting, sound design, and other post production techniques were done in Final Cut Pro. The movie is fueled by a scratch movie  soundtrack that emphasizes the \"mixing\" of a variety of genres and styles.  SYNOPSIS: In a decrepit metropolis, an evil plot is brewing.  A new animated shogun has come into power by slaying all of his opponents.  Only one threat remains to the evil shogun's power- his old sensei, Mitsurugi.  To dispose of his former teacher, the new shogun sends his most skilled assassin, Tatsumi, a live-action, bad-ass assassin from the 70's with an even more bad-ass handlebar mustache.  Meanwhile, in a parking garage across town, Mitsurugi (who looks like he was cut out of an old Kurosawa film) trains with his new student, a timid, small, poorly-drawn animated character, whose name can-not be mentioned due to licensing law-suit brought about by DC Comics (apparently the character too closely resembled a character created by Bob Kane).  Tatsumi arrives with pistol loaded.  A epic dual ensues between the old sensei and the assassin, resulting in the Mitsurugi's death.  The new student witnesses all of this, frozen in shock as his teacher is brutally slain in front of him.  He now must face his fears, and avenge his master's death.\n\t\t\t(more)\n\t\t\t(less)","tags":[],"views":10959,"author":"urbanshogun","videoId":"Nw5y08pBp-0","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1221075127000,"dateFeatured":"Wed, 10 Sep 2008 19:32:07 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080910193207","categories":["Film & Animation"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"The Waldo Ultimatum - The Imponderables","duration":165,"description":"Nominated for Best Web Clip in the 2008 Canadian Comedy Awards.

Veggie Burgers are a nutritional alternative to beef burgers.  Many people don't think of making their own veggie burgers but they are really easy to make at home.  Store bought veggie burgers are nutritional but often very high in sodium and preservatives.  You can substitute the eggs in this recipe with \"flax eggs\" which are a mix of 6 tbsp ground flax to 2 tbsp boiling water.  The milk in this recipe can be substituted with either soya milk or rice milk.  This make the recipe completely vegan!Lentils are high in fiber which makes them a good protector against bowel cancer. They are an excellent source of protein and are an important source of B vitamins, especially B3, which is essential for both a healthy nervous system and digestive system. They are high in iron, zinc and calcium and are a good replacement for red meat. Like meat, the iron in lentils is better absorbed when they are eaten with a good source of vitamin C like leafy green vegetables.Walnuts are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, a special type of fat that is essential for our bodies, but that the body cannot produce. Walnuts are also a very good source of monounsaturated fats.Walnuts contain many powerful antioxidants, including ellagic and gallic acids, pus antioxidant phenols and vitamin E. The minerals copper and manganese are also found in abundance in these tasty nuts.","tags":[],"views":56774,"author":"BeforeAndAft...","videoId":"Oy0NWgWrMdM","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1221428283000,"dateFeatured":"Sun, 14 Sep 2008 21:38:03 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080914213803","categories":["Howto & Style"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"Re: Summer Cooking Guru Challenge!!","duration":285,"description":"Magic Baked Potatoe on BBQ. \nI Accept Zeee Challonge! ..(said w/lousy french accent for d\n\t\n\n\t\t\tMagic Baked Potatoe on BBQ.

Veggie Burgers are a nutritional alternative to beef burgers.  Many people don't think of making their own veggie burgers but they are really easy to make at home.  Store bought veggie burgers are nutritional but often very high in sodium and preservatives.  You can substitute the eggs in this recipe with \"flax eggs\" which are a mix of 6 tbsp ground flax to 2 tbsp boiling water.  The milk in this recipe can be substituted with either soya milk or rice milk.  This make the recipe completely vegan!Lentils are high in fiber which makes them a good protector against bowel cancer. They are an excellent source of protein and are an important source of B vitamins, especially B3, which is essential for both a healthy nervous system and digestive system. They are high in iron, zinc and calcium and are a good replacement for red meat. Like meat, the iron in lentils is better absorbed when they are eaten with a good source of vitamin C like leafy green vegetables.Walnuts are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, a special type of fat that is essential for our bodies, but that the body cannot produce. Walnuts are also a very good source of monounsaturated fats.Walnuts contain many powerful antioxidants, including ellagic and gallic acids, pus antioxidant phenols and vitamin E. The minerals copper and manganese are also found in abundance in these tasty nuts.","tags":[],"views":null,"author":"","videoId":"Oy0NWgWrMdM","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1221473579000,"dateFeatured":"Mon, 15 Sep 2008 10:12:59 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20080915101259","categories":[""],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"Re: Summer Cooking Guru Challenge!!","duration":285,"description":"Magic Baked Potatoe on BBQ. \nI Accept Zeee Challonge! ..(said w/lousy french accent for d\n\t\n\n\t\t\tMagic Baked Potatoe on BBQ.

Tune is \"the Cuckoo\".- \"Tambiro\" made from a new (never-been-filled) 20 Lb. propane tank.-  My \"Fiddle-Gurdy\" combination fiddle & Hurdy Gurdy. Much fun! I apologize for the squeak here and there -- I was impatient to get things on Youtube. Tune is an old French Canadian Voyageur's melody, \"En Roullant Ma Boulle\".Inspiration from Yuichi Onoue's \"Kaisatsuko\".- My 4-string, full sized wash-tub bass. Holds it's own nicely in a band situation.- Simple Hardanger fiddle conversion. 4 strings playing & 4 strings sympathetic that run through a tunnel carved into the underside of the fingerboard. Tunes are \"Road to Boston\" (aka \"Col. Greene's March\") and \"Over the Waterfall\". - Low D Tin-Whistle made from a shower-curtain rod for a few dollars. Tune is made up on the spot (& it sounds it!).- Octave Mandolin (aka bozouki, cittern) converted from an old guitar. Tune is the \"Boys of Bluehill\" hornpipe.PS: I just put another short video on YouTube of my PVC tubing instrument that plays like a hang drum, at this web address:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5dD4KkJcAwPS: Also see my propane-tank hank drum at:http://youtube.com/watch?v=bpMS15kJyOY&mode=related&search=My webpage describing building these instruments is at this URL: http://www.ehhs.cmich.edu/~dhavlena/Thanks!PLEASE NOTE: A real, Swiss-made hang drum is VERY difficult to obtain these days. A ray of hope is on the horizon however-- Pantheon Steel, a maker of beautiful steel drums (\"steel pans\") is researching and experimenting -- with the intention of producing hang drums (under a different name) for sale.

Tune is \"the Cuckoo\".- \"Tambiro\" made from a new (never-been-filled) 20 Lb. propane tank.-  My \"Fiddle-Gurdy\" combination fiddle & Hurdy Gurdy. Much fun! I apologize for the squeak here and there -- I was impatient to get things on Youtube. Tune is an old French Canadian Voyageur's melody, \"En Roullant Ma Boulle\".Inspiration from Yuichi Onoue's \"Kaisatsuko\".- My 4-string, full sized wash-tub bass. Holds it's own nicely in a band situation.- Simple Hardanger fiddle conversion. 4 strings playing & 4 strings sympathetic that run through a tunnel carved into the underside of the fingerboard. Tunes are \"Road to Boston\" (aka \"Col. Greene's March\") and \"Over the Waterfall\". - Low D Tin-Whistle made from a shower-curtain rod for a few dollars. Tune is made up on the spot (& it sounds it!).- Octave Mandolin (aka bozouki, cittern) converted from an old guitar. Tune is the \"Boys of Bluehill\" hornpipe.PS: I just put another short video on YouTube of my PVC tubing instrument that plays like a hang drum, at this web address:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5dD4KkJcAwPS: Also see my propane-tank hank drum at:http://youtube.com/watch?v=bpMS15kJyOY&mode=related&search=My webpage describing building these instruments is at this URL: http://www.ehhs.cmich.edu/~dhavlena/Thanks!PLEASE NOTE: A real, Swiss-made hang drum is VERY difficult to obtain these days. A ray of hope is on the horizon however-- Pantheon Steel, a maker of beautiful steel drums (\"steel pans\") is researching and experimenting -- with the intention of producing hang drums (under a different name) for sale.

It took a while to make this happen! It also didn't help that my LaCie harddrive died with a lot of important footage on it. I was already making this video when it died and had to start from scratch. Don't. Buy. LaCie. Subtitle Typo: The subtitles for the lady speaking about the deep tube well was meant to read as \"It feels good to have this because all of us can use this TO drink and wash our food & dishes\". This was a bit difficult to translate and I had to actually consult two different people to help me translate this. In the process I seemed to have overlooked this grammatical typo.

Dr Taylor, an inventor and horologist, has put 500,000 pounds of his own money and seven years into developing the clock, which has been inspired from a design by a clock made by the legendary John Harrison, the pioneer of longitude.Of John Harrison's many innovations, he came up with the 'grasshopper escapement, explained Dr Taylor, referring to the device used by Harrison to turn rotational motion into a pendulum motion for timekeeping.No one knows how a grasshopper escapement works, so I decided to turn the clock inside out and, instead of making the escapement 35 mm across, it is 1.5 m across, he said.

A huge wave is not the disaster. The disaster is human. People who lost their family, that's the disaster. Somebody lost his livelihood; somebody lost his home; that's the disaster. Somebody doesn't have something to eat tonight; that's the disaster. So, this disaster is not just on the physical plane. A human being's suffering is hugely within himself, more than outside. A few packets of food may arrive, and he may get to eat; however, the new conditions - that he has to sit on the street side and eat, not in his home, and that his family has disappeared - that is the real disaster, the human part of it.\" - Sadhguru Tsunami Relief & Rehabilitation Isha Foundation which already operated centers in the coastal regions of Tamil Nadu was quick in its response to the unprecedented and catastrophic death and destruction caused by the tsunami on 26th December, 2004. In coastal areas of Chidambaram and Cuddalore and the devastated villages in Vellankovil and Nagapattanam, thousands of Isha volunteers from all walks of life tirelessly operated relief camps from the very first day, offering food, shelter, quality medical assistance and psychological relief to the victims. Specially designed Isha Yoga classes were also conducted to help those affected cope with the disaster, through physically and psychologically strengthening tools. Personally participating in the relief and rehabilitation programs,  Sadhguru made several visits to the affected areas -- closely directing and overseeing the process. Eight Mobile Health Clinics complete with their medical teams, supplies and thousands of volunteers were immediately moved from their project sites to the coast and put at the disposal of the district administration. Subsequently, in close working with the district administration, Isha Foundation adopted four villages in Cuddalore district and completed a model rehabilitation program that was highly acclaimed by the beneficiary communities and the state administration alike. In addition, Mobile Health Clinics were permanently dedicated to implementing the project Action for Rural Rejuvenation in 60 coastal villages.Isha Foundation delivered its first permanent house to the victims within 30 days of the disaster. The novel housing design developed promptly by Sadhguru himself, was certified as fire, earthquake, cyclone and tsunami proof by various institutions. Further, a boat manufacturing facility was set up on the premises of Isha Yoga Center to respond to the urgent need for fishing boats (the sole livelihood provider of coastal villagers). Volunteer engineers and professionals assisted to restore livelihoods lost through the calamity.A massive tree planting program and creation of a green belt through Project Green Hands was also undertaken and is ongoing in coastal villages affected by the tsunami.For in-depth information about Isha Foundation's Tsunami Relief and Rehabilitation operations please visitwww.ruralrejuvention.org/relief.http://www.ishafoundation.org/Disaster-Response/Tsunami-Reli ef-&-Rehabilitation.isa","tags":[],"views":1662,"author":"mndheenathay...","videoId":"lCNw3Q3TpQg","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1223652551000,"dateFeatured":"Fri, 10 Oct 2008 15:29:11 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20081010152911","categories":["Nonprofits & Activism"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"Documentary: \"A World of Conflict\"  Ch.13 - Sri Lanka","duration":367,"description":"This is Chapter 13,  Sri Lanka, of the documentary \"A World of Conflict\" in which reporter\n\t\n\n\t\t\tThis is Chapter 13,  Sri Lanka, of the documentary \"A World of Conflict\" in which reporter Kevin Sites covers every major war zone in the world in one year.

A huge wave is not the disaster. The disaster is human. People who lost their family, that's the disaster. Somebody lost his livelihood; somebody lost his home; that's the disaster. Somebody doesn't have something to eat tonight; that's the disaster. So, this disaster is not just on the physical plane. A human being's suffering is hugely within himself, more than outside. A few packets of food may arrive, and he may get to eat; however, the new conditions - that he has to sit on the street side and eat, not in his home, and that his family has disappeared - that is the real disaster, the human part of it.\" - Sadhguru Tsunami Relief & Rehabilitation Isha Foundation which already operated centers in the coastal regions of Tamil Nadu was quick in its response to the unprecedented and catastrophic death and destruction caused by the tsunami on 26th December, 2004. In coastal areas of Chidambaram and Cuddalore and the devastated villages in Vellankovil and Nagapattanam, thousands of Isha volunteers from all walks of life tirelessly operated relief camps from the very first day, offering food, shelter, quality medical assistance and psychological relief to the victims. Specially designed Isha Yoga classes were also conducted to help those affected cope with the disaster, through physically and psychologically strengthening tools. Personally participating in the relief and rehabilitation programs,  Sadhguru made several visits to the affected areas -- closely directing and overseeing the process. Eight Mobile Health Clinics complete with their medical teams, supplies and thousands of volunteers were immediately moved from their project sites to the coast and put at the disposal of the district administration. Subsequently, in close working with the district administration, Isha Foundation adopted four villages in Cuddalore district and completed a model rehabilitation program that was highly acclaimed by the beneficiary communities and the state administration alike. In addition, Mobile Health Clinics were permanently dedicated to implementing the project Action for Rural Rejuvenation in 60 coastal villages.Isha Foundation delivered its first permanent house to the victims within 30 days of the disaster. The novel housing design developed promptly by Sadhguru himself, was certified as fire, earthquake, cyclone and tsunami proof by various institutions. Further, a boat manufacturing facility was set up on the premises of Isha Yoga Center to respond to the urgent need for fishing boats (the sole livelihood provider of coastal villagers). Volunteer engineers and professionals assisted to restore livelihoods lost through the calamity.A massive tree planting program and creation of a green belt through Project Green Hands was also undertaken and is ongoing in coastal villages affected by the tsunami.For in-depth information about Isha Foundation's Tsunami Relief and Rehabilitation operations please visitwww.ruralrejuvention.org/relief.http://www.ishafoundation.org/Disaster-Response/Tsunami-Reli ef-&-Rehabilitation.isa","tags":[],"views":14642,"author":"mndheenathay...","videoId":"lCNw3Q3TpQg","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1223766371000,"dateFeatured":"Sat, 11 Oct 2008 23:06:11 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20081011230611","categories":["Nonprofits & Activism"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"Sam Amidon - Wedding Dress","duration":286,"description":"A video from director Sigga Sunna Reynisdóttir using puppets and stop-motion animation.The song is Sam Amidon's version of the traditional \"Wedding Dress\", found on his album \"All Is Well\" released by the Bedroom Community label.Puppets, puppeteer, scenography: Sigga Sunna Reynisdóttir.Camera, lights: Paul Corley.Editing: Laurel Barickman www.bedroomcommunity.netwww.samamidon.com","tags":[],"views":7790,"author":"BedroomCommu...","videoId":"WIIKHFN0svc","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1223883601000,"dateFeatured":"Mon, 13 Oct 2008 07:40:01 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20081013074001","categories":["Music"],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"A Car's life - YouTube game (1st Level)","duration":33,"description":"How to play:A \"Click\" button would appear for a quick second, time your click perfectly to advance ahead.

He was a nan dan, a male actor who specializes in female roles in the Beijing Opera. She departs for San Francisco, where she plans to get an abortion.

In the frontier city of Carpathia, Jasper Morello discovers that his former adversary Doctor Claude Belgon has returned from the grave. When Claude reveals that he knows the location of the ancient city of Alto Mea where the secrets of life have been discovered, Jasper cannot resist the temptation to bring his own dead wife Amelia back.

The fighting between the rebels and the Congolese army has heightened the need for food assistance, as hundreds of thousands flee their homes, leaving behind their farms and belongings. WFP is providing food assistance to a total of 145,000 displaced people near Goma and has completed distributions to almost 100,000 people in Rutshuru and Kiwanja, in rebel-held territory. A further three camps in rebel-held areas in the Masisi region have received WFP food over the past week. About 25,000 displaced people in two Kitchanga camps and 11,000 in Kilolirwe were provided with rations that will last 30 days.Persistent insecurity Despite a pull-back by rebels in the north-east, the persistent insecurity is preventing WFP from reaching many of the displaced. Heavy rains have also hampered food convoys from reaching the towns of Masisi and Lushebere, which are virtually cut off. We urge all parties in the conflict to put in place mechanisms that will allow humanitarian staff safe and unhindered access to people who are in desperate need, said Carlos Veloso, WFPs Emergency Coordinator for the eastern DRC crisis. WFP estimates that a total of 1.3 million displaced people and host family members are in need of food assistance in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. for more info and updates go to:http://www.wfp.org\n\t\t\t(more)\n\t\t\t(less)","tags":[],"views":48809,"author":"WORLDFOODPRO...","videoId":"jbNLZ-5CXFw","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1227914847000,"dateFeatured":"Fri, 28 Nov 2008 23:27:27 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20081128232727","categories":[""],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"SoGood.TV: Turkey, Stuffing, Gravy, and Wines","duration":656,"description":"http://SoGood.TV Heather Johnston, popular food and wine vlogger at SoGood.TV, demonstrates how to dress and cook a whole turkey for a holiday dinner, including how to make gravy using the bones and how to incorporate stuffing.

We urge all parties in the conflict to put in place mechanisms that will allow humanitarian staff safe and unhindered access to people who are in desperate need, said Carlos Veloso, WFPs Emergency Coordinator for the eastern DRC crisis.

This project shows an entertainment application based on Human-Robot Interaction, where the robot gives a new gaming dimension to that old-school arcade game.Rather than playing alone, the human player faces now a robot, which reacts according to the state of the game. Through appropriate speech dialogs and gestures, it engages the user in a fierce but unfair competition. Indeed, all disturbing techniques, such as in-game speech are included.Will you dare to beat the robot?For more information, please check the following websites:lasa.epfl.ch www.sauser.orgwww.calinon.ch\n\t\t\t(more)\n\t\t\t(less)","tags":[],"views":293293,"author":"SauserEric","videoId":"eH2n-7b0UIs","uploadDate":null,"comments":null,"stars":4.5,"numRatings":null,"age":null,"dateFeaturedEpoch":1228355538000,"dateFeatured":"Thu, 04 Dec 2008 01:52:18 GMT","timestampFeatured":"20081204015218","categories":[""],"selectedBy":null,"selectedByLink":null},{"title":"Killing Button","duration":313,"description":"Shocktobersketch 3, Week 1:Holy balls!
