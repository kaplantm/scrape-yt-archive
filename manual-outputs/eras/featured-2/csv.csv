Phoenix Vigil in Support of Cindy Sheehan,"My wife, daughter and I showed our support for Cindy Sheehan, the mother of the late Casey Sheehan, who died in 2004 in Iraq in service to our country. We weere part of  one of more than 1,400 candlelight vigils tonight across the United States. Sheehan is camped outside President Bush’s home in Crawford, Texas, waiting for a chance to speak to him about her son... wanting to know his life was not lost in vain.        We went to the vigil held at 24th Street and Camelback in Phoenix. It was a peaceful yet vocal protest. There were candles, placards and cheers as cars went by honking their horns in support.        The footage here is raw. I wanted to approximate the feel of the event. Whether or not you agree with Sheehan, you have to admire her courage and the strength of those who came out on a 99-degree evening to show their support.

c'était un rendez-vous,"On an August morning in 1978, French filmmaker Claude Lelouch mounted a gyro-stabilized camera to the bumper of a Ferrari 275 GTB and had a friend, a professional Formula 1 racer, drive at breakneck speed through the heart of Paris. The film was limited for technical reasons to 10 minutes; the course was from Porte Dauphine, through the Louvre, to the Basilica of Sacre Coeur.  No streets were closed, for Lelouch was unable to obtain a permit.  The driver completed the course in about 9 minutes, reaching nearly 140 MPH in some stretches. The footage reveals him running real red lights, nearly hitting real pedestrians, and driving the wrong way up real one-way streets.  Upon showing the film in public for the first time, Lelouch was arrested. He has never revealed the identity of the driver, and the film went underground until a DVD release a few years ago.

Baker Christmas Demo,"The third annual Baker Christmas Demo totally went in downtown Los Angeles. A full two or three thousand Kids showed up to watch Emerica pros Andrew Reynolds, Kevin “Spanky” Long, Leo Romero and am Braydon Szafranski obliterate the street course with their Baker teammates.  The demo was set up in conjunction with the Doogood Conservatory to help under-privileged kids during the holiday season. Three thousand canned food items were donated by skaters in return for raffle tickets to the world’s largest product giveaway!  A huge truckload of product was given out to a colossal crowd, and if you had a raffle ticket, you most likely walked away with a Baker deck and some Emerica apparel, at the very least. Emerica shoe certificates and other product were also given out.",baker,Skateboaring,Emerica,Hobbies & Interests,,robertbrink,PLcQIPltflM,3 days ago,,1135352489000,"Fri, 23 Dec 2005 15:41:29 GMT",20051223154129,Sports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Entertainment,,,,,

This year no Cannon Gun was fired by the infamous Tam the Gun, in real life known as, Staff Sergeant Thomas McKay, known as Tam the Gun, died at his home early on Thursday morning, 17th November 2005 at the age of 60. He had been suffering from cancer. :-( So for the first Scottish New Year in many years there was no gun fired on the hour chime, Tam's whisky lay waiting on top on the Cannon, and a lone piper played as the Fireworks went off as a mark of respect to Tam. He will be sadly missed here. But we still had the best Hogmanay (New years Eve) party in the world, as always we Scots know how to hold a party,people come here every New year from all over Europe and the rest of the world just for the all night party, we are a proud nation and we keep our traditions and heritage, and are proud of it. Enjoy the video, sorry I wanted to show all, but YouTube only allow 100 MB max, and my Video exceeded that, compressing the video only made the quality really bad, so it's best this way.

Hogmanay Live! - Happy New Year 2006 from Scotland,"Hogmanay Live! - Happy New Year 2006 from Scotland. Hosted by Jackie Bird (BBC Scotland News anchor) and Donny Monroe formally lead singer of the band Runrig - See the fireworks go off Live from Edinburgh castle, normally the biggest New year party in the world. This year no Cannon Gun was fired by the infamous Tam the Gun, in real life known as, Staff Sergeant Thomas McKay, known as Tam the Gun, died at his home early on Thursday morning, 17th November 2005 at the age of 60. He had been suffering from cancer. :-( So for the first Scottish New Year in many years there was no gun fired on the hour chime, Tam's whisky lay waiting on top on the Cannon, and a lone piper played as the Fireworks went off as a mark of respect to Tam. He will be sadly missed here. But we still had the best Hogmanay (New years Eve) party in the world, as always we Scots know how to hold a party,people come here every New year from all over Europe and the rest of the world just for the all night party, we are a proud nation and we keep our traditions and heritage, and are proud of it. Enjoy the video, sorry I wanted to show all, but YouTube only allow 100 MB max, and my Video exceeded that, compressing the video only made the quality really bad, so it's best this way. The beginning brings a tear to the eyes... Happy New Year 2006, and thanks for all your kind comments. I really didn't expect any hits, and placed it here only for my blog, so I'm very overwhelmed by the huge hits.

The Long Island Project Teaser Trailer,"This is the internet teaser trailer for the independent feature film ""The Long Island Project.""  This film was made by Eric Norcross and Francisco Pina and stars: Kevin Gall, Chris Diaz, Jack Moran, John Tully, Greg Vorob, Shareef Mcintosh, Dawn Simons, Robert Youngren and others.  YES--I do aspire to be a mainstream filmmaker, maybe that's why people are commenting positively about it.  I don't know--but what do you expect?  A video made by an amateur who has little interest in being mainstream and professional--or a video made by someone looking to acquire gigs--which is going to look better?

The Randy Bandits - Story Of Your Life (shower a capella),"Having spent the past four years bringing serious doses of heartfelt, mind-bending, tastefully indulgent melodious joy to New York area concert stages, THE RANDY BANDITS are going on record with their unique brand of genuine American music for their first full-length CD, REDBEARD.  Produced by revered pop craftsman Richard X. Heyman with Nancy Leigh and Spiff Wiegand and mixed by Kurt Reil of the Gripweeds, REDBEARD combines the genre-defying musicality of The Band, the earthy sincerity of Wilco and The Jayhawks, and the quirky pop smarts of Ben Folds Five and Guster for a welcome respite from the irony, detachment and jadedness found in much of today's new music. THE RANDY BANDITS will be hosting a CD Release Party for REDBEARD Friday, Feb. 17 in the Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard St., New York City. Show time is 8 p.m., with Byron Isaacs of Ollabelle and Tom Warnick opening. Tickets $10. Info: 212-219-3132 or www.knittingfactory.com.  REDBEARD encapsulates THE RANDY BANDITS' quest to put out new music in an entertaining way, to captivate fans (a.k.a. Fandits) with sincerity as well as lunacy, and to do something meaningful in a culture and business currently deluged with artifice and irony. The songs on REDBEARD swing from Rock to Country to Bluegrass to Jazz to Soul to Blues to Gospel with lots of hybrids, a jillion instruments traded amongst the musicians, and soaring vocal harmonies. The band's lyrics reflect the sensibility of their leader, award-winning playwright-turned-songwriter Jim Knable (""Spain""), who sings, plays acoustic guitar and sax, and is joined in THE RANDY BANDITS by Russ Kaplan (keyboards, vocals), Stephen Aleman (vocals, percussion), Spiff Wiegand (vocals, trumpet, mandolin, electric guitar, accordion and more), Chris Murphy (bass, vocals, electric guitar) and Adam Farrell (drums).  Together, they've focused attention to arrangement and performance since THE RANDY BANDITS' 2003 EP, The Woman ... or the Blues. The folky abandon has been left behind, but the spontaneity and downright madness their audiences love remains in full force.  We're sincere musical adventurers who believe in connecting to our audience with fun, humor and humanity,"" says Knable. ""We're not ironic. We're not about pop culture trendiness. We're about making really lasting music.""  REDBEARD is available through www.randybandits.com, www.cdbaby.com, www.amazon.com and exclusively in Manhattan at The Mudtruck on Wall Street and in Brooklyn at Soundtracks on 7th Ave.",randy,bandits,knitting,factory,,therandybandits,vTVcB5BxO1Y,3 days ago,,1139452529000,"Thu, 09 Feb 2006 02:35:29 GMT",20060209023529,red,beard,music,EPK,mudtruck,brooklyn,story,of,your,life,capella,Music,,,Entertainment,,,,,

THE RANDY BANDITS will be hosting a CD Release Party for REDBEARD Friday, Feb. 17 in the Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard St., New York City. Show time is 8 p.m., with Byron Isaacs of Ollabelle and Tom Warnick opening. Tickets $10. Info: 212-219-3132 or www.knittingfactory.com.  REDBEARD encapsulates THE RANDY BANDITS' quest to put out new music in an entertaining way, to captivate fans (a.k.a. Fandits) with sincerity as well as lunacy, and to do something meaningful in a culture and business currently deluged with artifice and irony. The songs on REDBEARD swing from Rock to Country to Bluegrass to Jazz to Soul to Blues to Gospel with lots of hybrids, a jillion instruments traded amongst the musicians, and soaring vocal harmonies. The band's lyrics reflect the sensibility of their leader, award-winning playwright-turned-songwriter Jim Knable (""Spain""), who sings, plays acoustic guitar and sax, and is joined in THE RANDY BANDITS by Russ Kaplan (keyboards, vocals), Stephen Aleman (vocals, percussion), Spiff Wiegand (vocals, trumpet, mandolin, electric guitar, accordion and more), Chris Murphy (bass, vocals, electric guitar) and Adam Farrell (drums).  Together, they've focused attention to arrangement and performance since THE RANDY BANDITS' 2003 EP, The Woman ... or the Blues. The folky abandon has been left behind, but the spontaneity and downright madness their audiences love remains in full force.  We're sincere musical adventurers who believe in connecting to our audience with fun, humor and humanity,"" says Knable. ""We're not ironic. We're not about pop culture trendiness. We're about making really lasting music.""  REDBEARD is available through www.randybandits.com, www.cdbaby.com, www.amazon.com and exclusively in Manhattan at The Mudtruck on Wall Street and in Brooklyn at Soundtracks on 7th Ave.",randy,bandits,knitting,factory,,therandybandits,vTVcB5BxO1Y,3 days ago,,1139456329000,"Thu, 09 Feb 2006 03:38:49 GMT",20060209033849,red,beard,music,EPK,mudtruck,brooklyn,story,of,your,life,capella,Music,,,Entertainment,,,,,

kangaroos,"eeeek! sorry..I didnt know that it will be plugged here n tube..I just uploaded that n tube to stick it to my web page so that my friends n my country can see..coz they keep asking me bout kangaroos eversince I arrived here n Australia..And the next thing happened is dat I received sooo many e-mails regarding comments from tube and its sux! It ruined my morning... But tenks to all who sent comments that its cute and kewl!Coz for me its truly a great video, to catch a kangaroo wherein shes n a state of scratching herself haha! To those who made bad comments..I wish I did not erase the video wherein I caught a kangaroo jacking off. I think that video would be a good entertainment for them..doh! To those who are asking where it is...It's in Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary Goldcoast Australia...Well the kangaroos look anorexic, skinny or inactive as how u describe them grrr! because some of them are sick! That is why they're there at the wildlife hospital...and because of that they are not capable of kicking a butt or wat did u say?? asses??? they can't attack people...and they are also well-behaved kangaroos...and to those who say It's boring to take video in a Zoo well..for me its not a Zoo just to display animals...IT'S A SANCTUARYS.. meaning ""HOLY"" It's a consecrative place..has a sacred purpose with Tranquility and Security...and also giv people a chance to have a face to face with them...wake up man!There are no places on earth that are not altered by man..It would be unbearable to think of a world in which the most majestic of the creatures of the land are no longer existed...Lucky we have sanctuaries to care and preserve them...",catch,you,scratch,Entertainment,,judiii,NwfPdDrDLtE,1 day ago,,1141982367000,"Fri, 10 Mar 2006 09:19:27 GMT",20060310091927,Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Arts & Animation,,,,,

Large hornet on hand,"This giant hornet was my pet for 7 months. Here she climbs onto my fingers and enjoys a snack of honey.  Note: This is not a Japanese giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia), but a Vespa ducalis, which comes really close in size. It is not a male, as someone claimed, it's a worker. Note the antennae and abdomen - males have an additional segment and a blunt abdomen, and long curved antennae. Their usual lifespan is merely several weeks, which is why I'm surprised myself. She isn't flying simply because she's busy eating. I caught her intending just to take some photos, but decided to keep her later. This is not in any way related to the cicada killer, it is a close relative of the European hornet Vespa crabro and the previously mentioned Japanese giant hornet. They never attack away from the nest. And yes, I have been stung by this species (but not this individual); it hurts somewhat; swollen hand, stiff fingers, but no lasting effect. She died naturally of old age.   Note also that this video is only to document how docile they can be away from the nest, and also the size of this magnificent insect.",Hornet,Hong,Kong,Asia,,vtropica,HuMS3KDNysM,23 hours ago,,1142486836000,"Thu, 16 Mar 2006 05:27:16 GMT",20060316052716,Vespa,ducalis,wasp,bee,pet,Hobbies & Interests,Pets & Animals,,,,,,,,Education & Instructional,,,,,

Re-Enactment: The Princess Bride,"The Seventh of my Re-enactment series.  Holy balls, this one took a while to finish, mainly because of the size. It clocked in as a whole gig when I had it as an .AVI.  This is the ""Battle of Wits"" scene from The Princess Bride. A mysterious man in black has been chasing three criminals who have kidnapped a princess. He has beaten a swordsman and a giant. Now all that's left is outsmarting the genius of the group, Vizzini, in a battle of wits.  Here's a list of what I used, and what they were supposed to represent in the scene.  My mask = a pair of boxers with holes cut in them My moustache = a brown-colored toothpick scotch-taped to my face Wine = Iced tea Wine bottle = a gallon of iced tea The Princess (scene briefly on the right of the screen near the beginning) = a rocking horse with a red shirt on it  Five minutes long... this is definitely the longest one.

It was only a small continuity error, and I'm not trying to focus on getting the scene picture perfect to the original. I'm focusing on the acting and dialogue.  I know I fell the wrong way. There was a desk to my right. I would have collided with it. ------------------------------ --------------  Here's a list of what I used, and what they were supposed to represent in the scene.

Vokor vs.Grimrott: Belegarth Spring War 2006,"Vokor vs. Grimrott: Mongolian wrestling, at Spring War 2006 - a Belegarth event. Belegarth is a Medieval Combat Sport, to learn more about it check out: www.belegarth.com. This was a video of some wrestling on the sidelines in between battles. The difference between what we do and what LARPers do is that we focus on the combat and are full force, full contact - it's an athletic martial sport vs. being a bunch of D&D; geeks out in the woods tap fighting. Vokor in real life is an MMA combatant, Grimrott is a martial arts instructor.
