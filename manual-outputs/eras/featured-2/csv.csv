Phoenix Vigil in Support of Cindy Sheehan,"My wife, daughter and I showed our support for Cindy Sheehan, the mother of the late Casey Sheehan, who died in 2004 in Iraq in service to our country. We weere part of  one of more than 1,400 candlelight vigils tonight across the United States. Sheehan is camped outside President Bush’s home in Crawford, Texas, waiting for a chance to speak to him about her son... wanting to know his life was not lost in vain.        We went to the vigil held at 24th Street and Camelback in Phoenix. It was a peaceful yet vocal protest. There were candles, placards and cheers as cars went by honking their horns in support.        The footage here is raw. I wanted to approximate the feel of the event.

Three thousand canned food items were donated by skaters in return for raffle tickets to the world’s largest product giveaway!  A huge truckload of product was given out to a colossal crowd, and if you had a raffle ticket, you most likely walked away with a Baker deck and some Emerica apparel, at the very least.

Hosted by Jackie Bird (BBC Scotland News anchor) and Donny Monroe formally lead singer of the band Runrig - See the fireworks go off Live from Edinburgh castle, normally the biggest New year party in the world. This year no Cannon Gun was fired by the infamous Tam the Gun, in real life known as, Staff Sergeant Thomas McKay, known as Tam the Gun, died at his home early on Thursday morning, 17th November 2005 at the age of 60. He had been suffering from cancer. :-( So for the first Scottish New Year in many years there was no gun fired on the hour chime, Tam's whisky lay waiting on top on the Cannon, and a lone piper played as the Fireworks went off as a mark of respect to Tam. He will be sadly missed here. But we still had the best Hogmanay (New years Eve) party in the world, as always we Scots know how to hold a party,people come here every New year from all over Europe and the rest of the world just for the all night party, we are a proud nation and we keep our traditions and heritage, and are proud of it. Enjoy the video, sorry I wanted to show all, but YouTube only allow 100 MB max, and my Video exceeded that, compressing the video only made the quality really bad, so it's best this way.

This year no Cannon Gun was fired by the infamous Tam the Gun, in real life known as, Staff Sergeant Thomas McKay, known as Tam the Gun, died at his home early on Thursday morning, 17th November 2005 at the age of 60. He had been suffering from cancer. :-( So for the first Scottish New Year in many years there was no gun fired on the hour chime, Tam's whisky lay waiting on top on the Cannon, and a lone piper played as the Fireworks went off as a mark of respect to Tam. He will be sadly missed here. But we still had the best Hogmanay (New years Eve) party in the world, as always we Scots know how to hold a party,people come here every New year from all over Europe and the rest of the world just for the all night party, we are a proud nation and we keep our traditions and heritage, and are proud of it. Enjoy the video, sorry I wanted to show all, but YouTube only allow 100 MB max, and my Video exceeded that, compressing the video only made the quality really bad, so it's best this way.

The Drift Doctor is in!!,This is Lucas drifting his 2003 Nissan 350Z. This was shot in Portland and edited by me. TAKE THIS VIDEO FOR WHAT IT IS!!!. He just got the car and we were out goofing off. This is by no means a pro video and YES it CAN drift on dry pavement. Just wait till the 1st drift day at PIR in march and ill have that video on here as well. I love to edit videos so comment about that and not weather or not its shitty driving or cause its wet so everyone can do it.....,Drift,350Z,doctor,,27,conjeo,VR05qs71quI,,91,1138875645000,"Thu, 02 Feb 2006 10:20:45 GMT",20060202102045,2 days ago,132,3.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Autos & Vehicles,,,,,

The Randy Bandits - Story Of Your Life (shower a capella),"Having spent the past four years bringing serious doses of heartfelt, mind-bending, tastefully indulgent melodious joy to New York area concert stages, THE RANDY BANDITS are going on record with their unique brand of genuine American music for their first full-length CD, REDBEARD.  Produced by revered pop craftsman Richard X. Heyman with Nancy Leigh and Spiff Wiegand and mixed by Kurt Reil of the Gripweeds, REDBEARD combines the genre-defying musicality of The Band, the earthy sincerity of Wilco and The Jayhawks, and the quirky pop smarts of Ben Folds Five and Guster for a welcome respite from the irony, detachment and jadedness found in much of today's new music. THE RANDY BANDITS will be hosting a CD Release Party for REDBEARD Friday, Feb. 17 in the Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard St., New York City. Show time is 8 p.m., with Byron Isaacs of Ollabelle and Tom Warnick opening. Tickets $10. Info: 212-219-3132 or www.knittingfactory.com.  REDBEARD encapsulates THE RANDY BANDITS' quest to put out new music in an entertaining way, to captivate fans (a.k.a. Fandits) with sincerity as well as lunacy, and to do something meaningful in a culture and business currently deluged with artifice and irony. The songs on REDBEARD swing from Rock to Country to Bluegrass to Jazz to Soul to Blues to Gospel with lots of hybrids, a jillion instruments traded amongst the musicians, and soaring vocal harmonies. The band's lyrics reflect the sensibility of their leader, award-winning playwright-turned-songwriter Jim Knable (""Spain""), who sings, plays acoustic guitar and sax, and is joined in THE RANDY BANDITS by Russ Kaplan (keyboards, vocals), Stephen Aleman (vocals, percussion), Spiff Wiegand (vocals, trumpet, mandolin, electric guitar, accordion and more), Chris Murphy (bass, vocals, electric guitar) and Adam Farrell (drums).  Together, they've focused attention to arrangement and performance since THE RANDY BANDITS' 2003 EP, The Woman ... or the Blues. The folky abandon has been left behind, but the spontaneity and downright madness their audiences love remains in full force.  We're sincere musical adventurers who believe in connecting to our audience with fun, humor and humanity,"" says Knable. ""We're not ironic. We're not about pop culture trendiness. We're about making really lasting music.""

Jihad Jerry & The Evildoers - Army Girls Gone Wild,"Greetings, Spuds.  Gerry Casale of DEVO is now Jihad Jerry and I declare that MINE IS NOT A HOLY WAR.

Large hornet on hand,"This giant hornet was my pet for 7 months. Here she climbs onto my fingers and enjoys a snack of honey.  Note: This is not a Japanese giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia), but a Vespa ducalis, which comes really close in size. It is not a male, as someone claimed, it's a worker. Note the antennae and abdomen - males have an additional segment and a blunt abdomen, and long curved antennae. Their usual lifespan is merely several weeks, which is why I'm surprised myself. She isn't flying simply because she's busy eating. I caught her intending just to take some photos, but decided to keep her later. This is not in any way related to the cicada killer, it is a close relative of the European hornet Vespa crabro and the previously mentioned Japanese giant hornet. They never attack away from the nest. And yes, I have been stung by this species (but not this individual); it hurts somewhat; swollen hand, stiff fingers, but no lasting effect. She died naturally of old age.   Note also that this video is only to document how docile they can be away from the nest, and also the size of this magnificent insect.",Hornet,Hong,Kong,Asia,57,vtropica,HuMS3KDNysM,,584,1142486836000,"Thu, 16 Mar 2006 05:27:16 GMT",20060316052716,23 hours ago,50,,Vespa,ducalis,wasp,bee,pet,Hobbies & Interests,Pets & Animals,,,,,,,,Education & Instructional,,,,,

Re-Enactment: The Princess Bride,"The Seventh of my Re-enactment series.  Holy balls, this one took a while to finish, mainly because of the size. It clocked in as a whole gig when I had it as an .AVI.  This is the ""Battle of Wits"" scene from The Princess Bride. A mysterious man in black has been chasing three criminals who have kidnapped a princess. He has beaten a swordsman and a giant. Now all that's left is outsmarting the genius of the group, Vizzini, in a battle of wits. ------------------------------ -------------- RECENT QUESTIONS AND STATEMENTS ANSWERED:  Yes, that is my actual voice. (Wtf?)  Yes, I realize that there is a glaring continuity error, and I hit myself for not noticing it. I didn't go back and fix it for two reasons:  1. I didn't feel like it. 2. It was only a small continuity error, and I'm not trying to focus on getting the scene picture perfect to the original. I'm focusing on the acting and dialogue.  I know I fell the wrong way. There was a desk to my right. I would have collided with it. ------------------------------ --------------  Here's a list of what I used, and what they were supposed to represent in the scene.  My mask = a pair of boxers with holes cut in them My moustache = a brown-colored toothpick scotch-taped to my face Wine = Iced tea Wine bottle = a tupperware container The Princess (scene briefly on the right of the screen near the beginning) = a rocking horse with a red shirt on it  Five minutes long... this is definitely the longest one.

Vokor vs.Grimrott: Belegarth Spring War 2006,"Vokor vs. Grimrott: Mongolian wrestling, at Spring War 2006 - a Belegarth event. Belegarth is a Medieval Combat Sport, to learn more about it check out: www.belegarth.com. This was a video of some wrestling on the sidelines in between battles. The difference between what we do and what LARPers do is that we focus on the combat and are full force, full contact - it's an athletic martial sport vs. being a bunch of D&D; geeks out in the woods tap fighting. Vokor in real life is an MMA combatant, Grimrott is a martial arts instructor. It had been raining on and off at this event, because of the mud Grimrott's knee pops in this video damaging his MCL/ACL.

I appreciate all the comments - but may I again stress that this is not serious, or really an ""art film"", so chill! [Also - not emo.

As for the pics: They're all of my boyfriend and I and places around where I live. Thanks to all the people who left constructive comments about filmmaking - very appreciated - and I must admit, it is a little like something out of the Ring, isn't it?  For those who asked: the main premise is pretty simple: boy and girl have been having problems, boy and girl work it out (sorta). Relatable, n'est pas?
