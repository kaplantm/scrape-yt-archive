It's an extensie driving tour through four of  New Orleans' most devastated neighborhoods supported with maps, interviews and an original score by Emmy nominated composer, Gil Talmi.  The full version of segment one is available on You Tube (keyword: NOVACDOC). \n \n \n \nIn addition to The Drive, NOVAC has collaborated with local filmmakers to produce a series of short documentaries on the people, culture and spirit that make New Orleans an American city worth rebuilding. \n \n \n \nPlease help us build awareness about what's going on in New Orleans by sharing our project with others.  We hope to convey the duality of life in post-Katrina New Orleans.  In many respects, things are progressing.  Families are moving home, cultural activities are abundant and, in some neighborhoods, life has a sense of near normalcy;  however, a short drive in almost any direction provides a different picture.  The magnitude of flooding was incomprehensible and nearly 10 months later, New Orleans has many challenges to overcome. \n \n \n \nTo view entire series including The Drive, enter YouTube keyword: NOVACDOC\n\t\t...

Wow! \n \nMy first attempt at camera-poetry reading. \n \nYou can see me forgetting the words and having to read it from the screen a lot, I apologize for that.  The whole camera concept is new to me when it comes to poetry, I'm used to an audience. \n \nHere's a hard copy of the poem: \n \nI sit in a hazy hole of drunken misconceptions \nstaring with disdain at a few select men \nwho sit perched over glass roses, \nfilled with an amber liquid \nand a maraschino cherry. \nThey clutch the crystal stems and take sips \nin between mumbled words. \n \nThere is a single connecting look \nin every pair of eyes. \nIt is the look of being \nso damned discontent. \nAnd they're drinking away yesterday, \nI can see it as it leaves their minds. \n \nThey try to drink fast enough \nto forget today and yesterday \nall at once. \nBut they never quite succeed, \nthough it doesn't keep them from trying. \n \nAnd I know that if I stumble into the same bar \nat about the same time tomorrow, \nthey'll be there again, \nsipping cocktails from glass roses \nthat have no leaves or thorns \nand smiling at the notion \nthat they no longer have a past.\n\t\t...
