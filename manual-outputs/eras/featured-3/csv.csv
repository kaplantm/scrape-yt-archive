Re-Enactment: Uncle Buck,192,"The Tenth of my Re-enactment series. 
 
Two weeks have gone by since my last video was uploaded... I've been lazy, I admit it. 
 
This is one of my favorite scenes of all time. John Candy's character goes to his niece's school to talk to her assistant principal about her behavior. He rips her a new one. 
 
The music before and after this scene plays a big part, so I couldn't resist beatboxing my own rendition of ""Wild Thing"" by Tone Loc in the end.  
 
I said I didn't want to do too many of these... but I think after doing ten, that statement holds no merit. Expect another re-enactment soon.

		The internet is under attack by huge telecoms like AT&T.; Americans across the country are fighting back, but does Washington, DC care? Or are they going to sell out the internet regardless? Musicians like Moby care because your ability to download and listen to music from iTunes and videos from youtube could be in jeopardy.

		First things first: if you know anyone in Korea could you forward the link to them? I'd love if it ended up in the inboxes of the kids from the video. 
 
As for the kids, when I was in Korea, I taught kindergarten. These are the kids I taught in the peter rabbit class. Oh, and before any one asks, Sherry (the queen) is saying ""kiss my hand"" not ""kiss my ass."" Her pronunciation is just a little strained. Also, the guy eating the cookie, in case you haven't guessed, is me. Though I'm a lot less blond now. The kids liked that. Blond hair in korea is like being a movie star or something.

		In a new approach to telling stories from the front lines of post-Katrina New Orleans, The New Orleans Video Access Center (NOVAC) is producing a one-hour documentary called The Drive.  It's an extensie driving tour through four of  New Orleans' most devastated neighborhoods supported with maps, interviews and an original score by Emmy nominated composer, Gil Talmi.  The full version of segment one is available on You Tube (keyword: NOVACDOC). 
 
 
 
In addition to The Drive, NOVAC has collaborated with local filmmakers to produce a series of short documentaries on the people, culture and spirit that make New Orleans an American city worth rebuilding. 
 
 
 
Please help us build awareness about what's going on in New Orleans by sharing our project with others.  We hope to convey the duality of life in post-Katrina New Orleans.  In many respects, things are progressing.  Families are moving home, cultural activities are abundant and, in some neighborhoods, life has a sense of near normalcy;  however, a short drive in almost any direction provides a different picture.  The magnitude of flooding was incomprehensible and nearly 10 months later, New Orleans has many challenges to overcome.

My first attempt at camera-poetry reading. 
 
You can see me forgetting the words and having to read it from the screen a lot, I apologize for that.  The whole camera concept is new to me when it comes to poetry, I'm used to an audience.

		::Edit:: Featured?! Wow! 
 
My first attempt at camera-poetry reading. 
 
You can see me forgetting the words and having to read it from the screen a lot, I apologize for that.  The whole camera concept is new to me when it comes to poetry, I'm used to an audience. 
 
Here's a hard copy of the poem: 
 
I sit in a hazy hole of drunken misconceptions 
staring with disdain at a few select men 
who sit perched over glass roses, 
filled with an amber liquid 
and a maraschino cherry. 
They clutch the crystal stems and take sips 
in between mumbled words. 
 
There is a single connecting look 
in every pair of eyes. 
It is the look of being 
so damned discontent. 
And they're drinking away yesterday, 
I can see it as it leaves their minds. 
 
They try to drink fast enough 
to forget today and yesterday 
all at once. 
But they never quite succeed, 
though it doesn't keep them from trying. 
 
And I know that if I stumble into the same bar 
at about the same time tomorrow, 
they'll be there again, 
sipping cocktails from glass roses 
that have no leaves or thorns 
and smiling at the notion 
that they no longer have a past.
